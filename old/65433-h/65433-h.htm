<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>THE CHUMS BACK HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-007.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning in early spring Mr. Watson rolled up the
shade at his bedroom window to see what kind of
weather was promised for the day when, glancing over
to the lane, whom should he see running down its long
stretch but Billy Whiskers, Stubby and Button.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I seeing things or is that really and truly my old Billy
Whiskers come back to the farm after being away all these years?&#8221;
he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;William, what <i>are</i> you talking about?&#8221; asked his wife, who was
yet in bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the window and see whether or not the goat, dog and
cat running along our lane are our old pets Billy, Stubby and
Button,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But of course they must be, for where in
the wide world would one ever find three such animals traveling
together?&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Watson was in her kimono and slippers and
at the window. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see him,&#8221; she said at last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t? Down there where the lane runs into the barnyard,&#8221;
said her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I see him now! And do look at the way all the cows,
horses, chickens and even Old Shep and Matilda, our tortoise shell
cat, are rushing to meet those three. Talk about animals not having
sense and feelings! Why, they are almost eating their old
friends alive! The way they are all rubbing noses and fussing over
them to show their joy at seeing them once more! I feel like hugging
them myself! Where do you suppose they have been all these
years?&#8221; Mrs. Watson asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I would give a good deal if those three could
talk and tell us where they have kept themselves and the experiences
they have had, for I wager my best hat they have had some very
exciting adventures with many hardships thrown in. I must hurry
and dress and then go out to see them,&#8221; said Mr. Watson. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want them to think I am not as glad to see them as my animals
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a few minutes and I will go with you,&#8221; said his wife,
bustling about.</p>

<p>When Billy, Stubby and Button saw Mr. and Mrs. Watson coming,
they ran to greet them. Billy nearly baaed his head off to
show his delight, while Stubby twisted his body into hard knots and
wiggled his stub of a tail so fast one could scarcely see it. As for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Button, he rubbed himself against them until he almost wore the
skin off his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we are glad to see you back,&#8221; said Mr. Watson, &#8220;and we
hope you are going to stay with us and not run off right away. My
dear, you take Stubby and Button to the house and give them a big
breakfast while I do the same for Billy here at the barn. My sakes
alive, whom do we see coming on the run from behind the barn but
the whole Billy Whiskers family! The procession is headed by
Nannie, Billy&#8217;s dear little wife. From the surprise so plainly
shown in all their faces they could not have known he was going to
arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, William, look! From the way they are greeting one
another one would think they were humans instead of animals!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what, my dear, you see before you six of the finest
full-blooded Angora goats you could find in a lifetime. They are
all so big, strong and handsome, and have such silky hair and graceful
horns. Billy and Nannie are pure white and perfectly mated.
So too are Billy Junior and Daisy, his wife. Billy Junior&#8217;s coal-black
hair makes a fine contrast against Daisy&#8217;s coat. As for the
Twins, they are their father and mother over again, Punch being
black and Judy white.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-010.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Now Billy is back, we can expect exciting things to happen,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Watson, &#8220;for wherever he is, there is always something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
going on. See, William, what is next to welcome them!
How those pigeons and doves cluster around them, some even alighting
on their backs! As they are the mail carriers for the animals,
before night every farm for
miles around will hear the
glad tidings that Billy
Whiskers, Stubby and Button
are back home. See!
Didn&#8217;t I tell you? There
they go now, flying in all
directions! Here, Stubby,
Stubby, Stubby! Here, Button,
Button, Button! Come
with me and get something
to eat!&#8221; she called as she
turned toward the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, grandfather,
stand still
and watch
me,&#8221; said Punch to
Billy Whiskers. &#8220;I
can jump so high! See, I can jump over your back!&#8221; and he ran off
a few yards and then made a flying jump over Billy&#8217;s back. &#8220;I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
learned to do that while you have been away on your travels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was pretty good, but next time raise your feet a little higher
for you nearly took a chunk out of my back,&#8221; warned Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can beat Punch jumping,&#8221; said Judy, &#8220;though he says I can&#8217;t
because I am a girl. Watch me and see if I can&#8217;t!&#8221; But just when
she jumped, Billy moved away and she leaped high in the air with
nothing under her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, grandfather, what made you move? Now stand still and I
will do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you! I&#8217;ll take your word for it that you can jump
higher than your brother; I can&#8217;t spare any more of my flesh to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy, you stand still then and let me jump over you,&#8221; pleaded
Judy.</p>

<p>Billy Junior heaved a sigh of resignation and stood still while
Judy leaped over him, her feet held so close to her body that there
was a full foot between his back and her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;See! Don&#8217;t I jump higher and better than Punch?&#8221; she asked
proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, children,&#8221; exclaimed Daisy, their mother, &#8220;don&#8217;t always be
vying with one another. All you do these days is to argue. Can&#8217;t
you play without quarreling and fussing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t fuss or quarrel, mother. We just tell each other what
we think and want.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t do it so emphatically then,&#8221; replied their mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there goes Farmer Jones&#8217; flock of goats down the road to
the pasture. Can&#8217;t we go with them? It is such fun to play with
them in their pasture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you may go if their man will let you. But I am afraid when
he sees you he will drive you back,&#8221; replied Daisy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if he does, we will wait until he gets them in the pasture
and goes home. Then we will run down the road and crawl under
the fence. There is a big hole we know about that is large enough
for us to crawl through, for we were down there yesterday and
crawled through and played with them all the afternoon. Come
on, Punch, let&#8217;s go and try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And off they scampered, while Billy Whiskers followed Mr. Watson
to the barn door where he waited for him to bring out his breakfast.
He soon returned with a peck of carrots and some oats, and
while Billy ate, the animals and fowls stood around and asked questions
as to where he had been, and eagerly listened as he told what
he had seen.</p>

<p>When Stubby and Button reached the house with Mrs. Watson
they found Bridget waiting at the door&mdash;the cook who had been
there when they left the old farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well!&#8221; she exclaimed on seeing the two, &#8220;and is it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
yezselves I see wid me two eyes? And glad I am to see ye! Though
I know yer heads must be filled wid devilment ye have picked up
while yez were away. And yez had enough to last ye all yer life
when yez lift us! Unless time has put some sinse in yer heads,
which I hope it has! But here! Yez didn&#8217;t come home to hear me
talk but to git something to eat. Just wait around a minute and
I&#8217;ll give yez the best breakfast yez have had since yez lift, and one
that&#8217;ll make yezselves stick out like barrels!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bridget is the same old girl, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; said Stubby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; her bark is worse than her bite,&#8221; replied Button. &#8220;Yum,
yum! I smell something delicious cooking, and here she comes with
two plates heaped full of food!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had just finished their meal when Bridget came rushing out
of the kitchen with the broom held high over her head, exclaiming,
&#8220;Come along, Stubby and Button, and hilp me drive out that cross
old cow that is always coming into our yard and eating up our
flowers!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-014.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The cow was standing in the middle of the flower bed making
havoc of it, and Bridget charged on her with the broom, but instead
of stopping eating, the cow lowered her head and made for Bridget
on the run. Bridget turned and fled toward the porch, the cow close
at her heels. She was just ready to hook the woman when she herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
had a surprise for she found herself facing two angry eyes and
a pair of horns twice as sharp as her own. And before she could
hook whatever this was before her, she felt two sharp horns running
into her side and pushing her sideways. She came to the conclusion
that it was about time for her to make a hasty departure. As she
turned toward the gate she found herself hurried through it by a
little dog barking and snapping at her heels and then hanging to her
tail. Though she tried again and again to kick him, she could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
succeed, for when she kicked out with one foot, he was always snapping
at the other leg. He chased her down the road for a mile and
then with a parting warning not to come into that yard again, he let
her go.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day the Chums wandered around the farm to
see what improvements had been made and to meet the new animals
that had been bought by Mr. Watson while they had been away.
And when they went to bed that night, all three declared there was
no place in all the whole wide world like the dear old farm.</p>

<small>SAL SCRUGS MAKES TROUBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EARLY the next morning from far and near came pigeons,
blackbirds, swallows, robins and every other
kind of bird that makes its home in Wisconsin in the
summer. They had heard the news that the Chums
had returned and now hastened to extend them a welcome on their
own account as well as to deliver greetings from the animals on the
different farms round about who were unable to get away, as most
of them were either fenced in their pastures or shut up in their
stables.</p>

<p>One homely, raw-boned, cross-eyed cow named Sal Scrugs whom
no one liked and at whom everyone threw stones because she was
always in mischief of some kind, said she was not going to send her
message but was going to deliver it in person as these three were the
only animals that had ever been nice to her. <i>They</i> understood and
knew that the reason she behaved so badly was that everyone had
always been so mean to her and never given her a kind word because
she was so homely. She could not help being homely, and it had
only soured her disposition to be treated so and called horrid names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
when it was no fault of her own. She said, &#8220;Very well, if people
treat me badly, I will be more tricky and disagreeable than they ever
thought of being.&#8221; So from calfhood she had <i>tried</i> to be mean.
She would jump all the fences she could, trample people&#8217;s gardens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and eat their early vegetables. Then too she would milk herself so
when they wanted to milk her she would be dry. Another trick was
to break down the fence and let all the other stock out. Consequently
when she said she was going to see Billy, all the animals
where she lived knew she would do it by jumping the fence in the
pasture and running off.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-018.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Listen, friends,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to ask you a question. How
many of you would like to go to see Billy Whiskers, Stubby and
Button if you had the chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all would, I know,&#8221; spoke up an old brindle cow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely we would!&#8221; piped up all the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then. When I am down in the pasture away from the
house where no one can see me, I will break down the fence and you
can all get out and run down the road and see the Chums before anyone
knows you have left the pasture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be fine!&#8221; said one of the young heifers. &#8220;I would
just love a lark like that! Anything to cause a little excitement!
We lead such a quiet life here with no change from day to day,
month in and month out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but how will you like it if, after we are out, Mr. Watson&#8217;s
hired man sics Shep on us and he bites your legs and hangs on your
tail? I tell you that dog has sharp teeth and gives a vicious bite for
he has snapped at me more than once when I have not walked fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
enough to suit him. You must remember I was born on the Watson
farm and lived there until I was four years old, when I was sold to
Mr. Jones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! I am willing to take the chance and the bite too
for a little fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes the hired man to drive us to pasture,&#8221; said Sal
Scrugs.</p>

<p>Very sedately all the cows walked down the road to the pasture
and after the man had shut them in, they lingered around the gate
until he disappeared from sight over the brow of the hill. Then
with a merry Ha! Ha! bellow in her throat, Sal Scrugs said, &#8220;Follow
me along the fence until we come to the weak place in it.
There are two loose posts that with a good hard push will fall
right over into the road and then we can all pass through the opening
and be free. Free! Oh, it is glorious to feel free!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sal was about to throw her weight against the weak section of
the fence when one of the cows said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute! I think I hear a wagon coming down the
road. We must wait until it passes or we will be caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they patiently waited until a big lumbering wagon had passed
and disappeared over the hill. Then with a rush Sal ran to the
fence and threw herself against it with all her might. Down it went
with a crash and over toppled the posts as well. This made a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
wide place for them to go through. They were in such a hurry to
get out before any more wagons came along to stop them that two
or three of the cows fell down in their mad haste to be on the way to
see Billy, Stubby and Button. One cow hurt herself badly as she
rushed over the fallen rails and she had to walk with a limp all the
way to the Watson farm.</p>

<p>Billy and Nannie were on top of the old straw stack, their favorite
resting place, for from there they could see all that went on in the
barnyard directly under them and for two miles all around them.</p>

<p>Billy had just finished telling Nannie of one of his narrow escapes
when, looking down the road, what should he see but all of Farmer
Jones&#8217; small herd of cattle coming on the run down the road. Indeed,
before he could tell Nannie to look, they were turning in at
the Watson lane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who is chasing them. It must be some stray dog for
their own dog Nig knows cows should never be made to run,&#8221; said
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I see no dog, or man either, Billy,&#8221; said Nannie. &#8220;See, they
have spied us up on the stack and are making for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>By that time the foremost cow had reached the stack and each one
was mooing to express the joy it gave her to see Billy back again and
finding him as well and as strong as when he had left.</p>

<p>&#8220;A speech! A speech!&#8221; they called.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Billy stood up on the straw stack where all could see and hear him.
&#8220;Very dear and old tried-and-true friends, I cannot tell you with
what joy I see you all again, and the welcome home you are giving
me touches my heart most deeply.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-022.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Just at this point his speech was interrupted by Mr. Watson and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Shep running into the barnyard to drive out the stray cows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Watson. &#8220;Instead of strange
cattle these belong to Mr. Jones. They must have broken out of
their pasture. Come, Shep, we will drive them back. Not so
fierce there, Shep! There is no need to snap at them and hang on
their tails, for you see they are going peacefully enough. And you
must never snap or bite at an animal when it is going along quietly
minding its own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, Billy! Good-by! Anyway, we saw you before we
were driven back, and we are glad we broke down the fence and
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away from me, you nasty dog! Can&#8217;t you see I am hurrying
as fast as I can with a lame leg?&#8221; said the young cow whose aunt
had warned her if she ran away a dog might snap at her heels and bite
her. &#8220;I seem to be the only one that was hurt or at whom the dog
really took a nip. But I don&#8217;t regret coming in the least, for I never
saw Billy Whiskers before. I had heard so much about him that I
wanted to see for myself if he was as wonderful as all the cows,
horses, sheep, pigs and goats said he was. And he certainly is. My,
but he looked handsome as he stood up on that straw stack addressing
the crowd below, with his long white beard blowing in the wind
and the sunshine making his silky white hair glisten like silver!
Well, here we are back at our pasture. You may be sure I shall look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
out as I walk over those old rails this time so that I don&#8217;t hurt myself
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the cows were all in, Mr. Watson tried to patch up the opening
but he could not succeed in making the posts stand up, so he said
to Shep, &#8220;Shep, you stay here and watch the cattle. Don&#8217;t let them
come through the opening. I am going to tell Mr. Jones about his
broken fence. Now mind, don&#8217;t let a single cow out!&#8221; and whistling,
he turned and walked toward the Jones farmhouse.</p>

<p>He was scarcely out of sight when Sal Scrugs said, &#8220;Watch me
pass that dog! If he tries to stop me, I shall send him a mile down
the road and then if he comes at me again I shall hook him up in the
air twenty-five feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here, Sal Scrugs, you are courting trouble for yourself!
Shep won&#8217;t hurt you if you behave, but just let any cow try to
hook him and he will bite in earnest. What is more, he will bring
you back to the herd if it takes him all day. Any animal he starts
out to get, he gets if it takes all day to do it,&#8221; said the old cow that
used to live at Mr. Watson&#8217;s, and therefore knew Shep and his ways
well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! I&#8217;ll see a dog try to stop me! I always out-run them for,
as you know, I have extra long legs which help me to jump fences
and out-run dogs. And as I always keep in practice, I don&#8217;t get out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
of breath like most cows do. Then too my bag is small so it never
bothers me by swinging from side to side when I run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same you will find Shep is an unusual dog, and he would
consider it a disgrace to allow a cow to get away from him after he
had been told to watch it.&#8221;</p>

<small>SAL SCRUGS DEFIES SHEP</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-027.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;ANYHOW I am going to try it,&#8221; determined Sal. &#8220;I
can but fail, and it will give the rest of you stay-at-homes
something to bet on&mdash;whether I win or the dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you come home with bleeding ankles and half
your tail pulled out, don&#8217;t say no one warned you not to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Shep is half asleep, stretched there in the middle of the
broken fence, thinking to himself that none of the cows will even
try to pass him! I&#8217;ll just go pretty near the opening, eating as I
go along, until I see him close his eyes. Then I&#8217;ll take a running
jump over the fallen rails and off down the road I&#8217;ll go. I&#8217;ll take
the road from home as there is a nice thick woods down that way
where I can hide until he stops hunting for me,&#8221; said Sal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you you aren&#8217;t counting on Shep being different from other
dogs who have chased you. But you will find there are dogs&mdash;and
dogs. Shep belongs to the kind that never give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Tee hee! Keep your eyes open for I am off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later there was a sharp bark from Shep and when
the cows stopped eating to look up to see what caused it, all they saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
was a thick cloud of dust, with Sal Scrugs running like mad and a
bundle of yellow hair following in leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; said Sal Scrugs to herself. &#8220;That dog is gaining on
me! I thought that with my long legs I could out-run any dog, but
this one is coming like the wind and is surely gaining on me. My
only hope is to jump this barbed wire fence which he can&#8217;t crawl
through, and make for the woods at the other side of the field where
he can&#8217;t see me.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-029.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Just as Shep reached her and gave one nip at her heels, taking out
a small piece of flesh, Sal jumped the fence. It being higher than
she calculated, instead of landing on her feet as usual, she caught her
foot on the top wire, which threw her on her nose and she fell, nearly
breaking her neck. But in a minute she was up and off again across
the field, running faster than ever for now she began to know for
a certainty that unless she gained the shelter of the woods and hid in
the thick underbrush, she was lost and Shep would bite her unmercifully
unless she went back to the herd. And she did not care to return
and endure their laughter at her expense after all her vain
boasting.</p>

<p>While she was running across the lot for dear life, Shep was barking
in anger at the closely woven barbed wires that kept him from
the pursuit. He tried jumping the fence, but could not and was
about to run around the field when he spied a small hole under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
fence. In a jiffy he was scratching, making the dirt fly out in a
shower behind him as he made the hole large enough for him to
squeeze under. And just as Sal Scrugs entered the woods
and turned her head to see where Shep was, expecting to
see him running aimlessly up and down
the road, she saw him coming like mad,
already half way across the field. With
a quick plunge into the deep bushes, she stood still,
hoping to hide from him. She scarcely breathed for
fear of betraying her presence, but
alas, she had forgotten that dogs do
not have to trust to
their eyes to find
things, but that
they are given a
sense of smell which
aids them wonderfully.</p>

<p>The minute Shep entered
the woods, he saw some
bushes were slightly moving, so he went directly to them and as he
approached the scent of a cow grew stronger and stronger. Peering
through the bushes, he spied Sal Scrugs standing stock still, staring
back at him, her eyes distended with fear. For by this time Sal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Scrugs knew she had found her master and was frightened to death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you, Sal, come out of those bushes and march straight back
to the pasture, or I&#8217;ll nip your ankles until they bleed!&#8221; barked Shep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind, for you don&#8217;t belong to our farm and
consequently it is none of your business what I do!&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it <i>is</i> my business because my master told me not to allow
a single cow out of the pasture while he was gone. You heard him
say it! Still you thought you would go, just to be mean. Now I&#8217;ll
bark three times and on the third bark you chase yourself toward
home or I&#8217;ll show you. And what is more, I&#8217;ll bite you every time
you try to get away from me. Bow, wow, wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>By the second &#8220;Wow!&#8221; Sal Scrugs bounded out of the bushes in
the opposite direction from the pasture and hooked her way through
the thick bushes straight for a little lake that lay sparkling in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you long-legged, cross-eyed cow, don&#8217;t think you are going
to lose <i>me</i> in these woods! For you are not, even if the thorns and
briars do pull the hair off my skin!&#8221;</p>

<p>On, on, faster and faster went Sal Scrugs, straight for the lake,
though the hide on her back was scratched by the long, cruel thorns
on the thorn apple trees under which she ran. Anything was better
than being bitten by Shep! She had just come out of the woods to
a smooth piece of ground where she expected to make great headway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and out-distance Shep when, chancing to look behind her, she saw
Shep within thirty feet of her, running with mouth open and showing
to advantage his glistening teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my! He is going to catch me! But I will try one more way
to dodge him. I will run into the lake.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-032.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>She increased her speed but to no avail. She could hear him coming
closer and closer and just as she reached the shore of the lake she
felt his warm breath on her legs and expected to feel his sharp teeth
sink in her ankles when, with one plunge, she threw herself into the
deep water and began to swim for the opposite shore. Shep did
likewise, and her hope that he would not follow her into the water
was blasted. As she swam, he barked to her: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t turn
toward the pasture when we land, I will bite a big piece out of your
hind leg, and no fooling about it, either!&#8221;</p>

<p>On hearing this, Sal said to herself, &#8220;I guess he means it so I might
just as well give up now and go back to the pasture as to wait until
I am all bitten up. I guess my aunt was right. Shep never gives
up chasing an animal until he has it where he wants it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Consequently when she landed on the opposite shore, she cut sticks
for the home pasture as fast as her legs would carry her.</p>



<p>What was Shep&#8217;s surprise when he returned to find that while he
had been gone all the other cows had walked out of the pasture and
were now ambling leisurely down the road away from home! But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
it took only a few minutes for him to run past them and head them
toward home again. He had just succeeded in getting them all back
in the pasture and was taking a much needed rest when he saw Mr.
Watson, Mr. Jones and their two hired men coming down the road
to mend the fence. When they arrived, Mr.
Watson noticed that Shep was wringing wet
and he said, &#8220;Why, Shep, how in the world
did you manage to get so wet? There is
no water nearer than the lake, and I do
not think you would leave the cows you
were in charge of long enough to
go for a swim.&#8221; But
chancing to look up
just then, he saw Sal
Scrugs too was wet all
over, and he exclaimed, &#8220;I think I begin to see light! That impish
cow of yours, Sal Scrugs, got out of the pasture and went over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the lake, and she and Shep have both been in the water. And I
think if the truth were known, it was she who broke down the fence
and let out all the other cows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so, too,&#8221; replied Mr. Jones, &#8220;and this settles it. I am
tired of her tricks and I am going to put her up for sale to-morrow.
She never gave much milk, and I can&#8217;t fatten her for beef; no matter
how much I feed her, she never takes on a pound of flesh. So why
keep such a mean animal? Sal Scrugs, you hear that? You are to
be sold to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you wish you had taken your old aunt&#8217;s good advice
and not broken down the fence?&#8221; twitted one of the herd.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t! I have had some excitement, and I would just as
soon be sold as not, for I am tired living my life among such old
fogies as you! If I don&#8217;t like the people to whom he sells me, I shall
jump the fence and run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and if you keep that up much longer, you will find yourself
hung up by one leg on a hook in a butcher shop one of these days.
But I am only wasting breath talking to you,&#8221; said Sal&#8217;s aunt and she
turned her back and walked off, shaking her head in dismay at the
actions of her wayward niece.</p>

<small>AN INVITATION TO A &#8220;WELCOME HOME&#8221; PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-035.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Billy Whiskers and his family were eating their
breakfast the next morning, who should come fluttering
down beside them but a beautiful fan-tailed pigeon
from Mr. Smith&#8217;s farm, bearing an urgent invitation
to Mr. and Mrs. Billy Whiskers, Mr. and Mrs. Billy Whiskers, Jr.,
as well as Stubby and Button, to attend that very night, as soon as
the moon was up, a &#8220;welcome home&#8221; party Mr. and Mrs. Spotted
Goat were giving in honor of the home-coming of Billy
Whiskers and his Chums. The affair was to be held in the
hollow between two high hills down in the pasture by the side of the
little brook. And all the other animals on the Watson farm were
likewise invited, as were those on the Jones farm. Even the pigs
had been bidden to the feast of welcome!</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Mr. and Mrs. Spotted Goat for their kind invitation to
myself and family. Give them our regards and tell them we all
accept, including Stubby and Button, and that I personally consider
it a great honor for them to give such a party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, grandfather, can&#8217;t we go too?&#8221; asked Punch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Do say yes, grandfather!&#8221; pleaded Judy. &#8220;We want to go so
much! We love to play with the little goats and lambs on the Smith
farm, and we won&#8217;t be a bit of bother or get into mischief even once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, truly, we won&#8217;t!&#8221; chimed in Punch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, but I could not take you out to an evening party. Besides,
no children are included; just grown-ups.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but we won&#8217;t bother them. We can get some of the little
kids and lambs and go away off from the party to play. Oh, do let
us go! We never have been to a big party like that,&#8221; pleaded Judy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; commanded their mother, &#8220;stop teasing. You cannot
go and that settles it. Besides, what did I tell you, Judy? If you
do not break yourself of this habit of teasing, I will punish you
severely. It is a most annoying habit for a kid to have. I simply
won&#8217;t permit you to do it. What is more, you need not go off pouting
for that is as bad as teasing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Twins walked off behind the barn with gloomy faces, but
they had scarcely turned the corner when Judy&#8217;s face brightened,
and she exclaimed, &#8220;I tell you what let&#8217;s do, Punch! Let&#8217;s run away
and go over to Mr. Smith&#8217;s farm and watch them prepare for the
party and play with Mrs. Spots&#8217; twins. We can have a fine time
before the party begins. Almost as much as if we went to it, for we
won&#8217;t have the grown-ups there to say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t do that!&#8217; to us all the
time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;Oh, Judy, you are a brick for thinking of that plan! It will be
lovely. I&#8217;ll go ask mother if we may go down in the pasture and
play in the brook,&#8221; replied Punch.
&#8220;If we ask her, they won&#8217;t be looking
for us all the time and discover
we are gone. You know our pasture
adjoins Mr. Smith&#8217;s where the
party is to be held, and the same
brook runs through both. We can
walk up the stream and crawl under
the wire that stretches
across the stream to separate
the two pastures.
And if we
should happen
to get on the
other side of
the wire when
wading, no one could blame
us for not noticing <i>that</i>,
could they?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-037.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Of course not! Run along and ask her. I&#8217;ll wait for you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, where are you?&#8221; called Punch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>&#8220;Over here by the watering trough,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mother, may Judy and I go down in our meadow and play
by the brook? It is so nice and cool down there and we love to
stand in the water and watch the fish swim around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you will be careful and stay away from the holes, for you
could easily drown in one of them, the water is so deep. But you
well know where they are, don&#8217;t you? Each one has a long stick
driven in it, standing well out of the water, with a red flag on it. So
you can&#8217;t help knowing where they are. Good-by, and come home
early for luncheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t promise about that. We may be having too good a time
to come home and we can eat some nice green grass and peppermint
down by the stream, which will be a better luncheon than you will
have. So don&#8217;t look for us, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well! Be good children, and be careful about the deep
holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. We won&#8217;t go near the holes. Good-by!&#8221; and Punch
was off with a skip and a jump around the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah! We may go, Judy! Come along! I&#8217;ll
race you down the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very nice of Mr. and Mrs. Spots to give a party for us and
such a big one, too, for there are dozens of animals on the farms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
round about us, and they have invited them from every farm that
adjoins theirs,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you must remember, my dear, that not one-third of them
will be able to come, as they cannot get out of their stables and pastures
on account of the high fences and the locked doors of the
stables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that. But isn&#8217;t it a shame they cannot get away, for
they all have such quiet lives that it would do them good to have a
little excitement now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here come some of the sheep and goats to ask you not what they
shall wear, having only one dress to their names, but how in the
world they are to get the dirt off their wool and hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. and Mrs. Billy Whiskers! Isn&#8217;t it lovely
that the Spots are going to give a party for you?&#8221; said Mrs. Wire
Hair, one of the goats. &#8220;But I am in despair. Just look at my
hair! It is all stained with yellow clay. And worse than that, with
black muck, too. I nearly stranded in the quagmire down by the
pond yesterday and now I am a sight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of us looks particularly well,&#8221; said another. &#8220;What say
you we have a swimming party and all go down to the brook and
stand in the water until the stain and dirt is washed off?&#8221; said Billy
Whiskers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;A splendid idea! We knew if we came to you, Mr. Whiskers,
you would think of some way we could look respectable at the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>In less than half an hour, had you stood on the brow of the hill
in the Watson barnyard and gazed down into the valley, you would
have seen cows, horses, pigs, goats and sheep all standing in the pond
into which the stream widened. Every animal had a happy face, for
was not the water washing off the grime in fine shape? Billy&#8217;s and
Nannie&#8217;s long white hair would soon look like spun silk. As for
Button, he sat on a flat rock on the bank and licked his fur until it
shone as if made of black satin.</p>

<p>All this time what do you suppose those mischievous Twins were
doing but helping the Spots family carry things to eat down to the
pasture where the party was to be? There was a shock of fresh
green cornstalks in the Spots barnyard and this delicacy Mr. and
Mrs. Spots, their children and several horses and cows were pulling
out of the shock and carrying in their mouths down by the stream
where the party was to be given. If the Twins had been asked to do
this at home, they would have carried one mouthful and then complained
that their legs were weary with climbing the hill. But to
do it for other people was fun, and they never complained once, nor
stopped until Mrs. Spots said they would not dare to carry away any
more or it would be missed by Mr. Smith when he came into the
barnyard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>As it was, Mr. Smith did wonder why it was so many of his horses,
cows and pigs stayed in the barnyard that morning instead of going
out into the pasture to eat the nice fresh clover. But finally he passed
it by, thinking they just happened to remain as in all probability they
had come in from the pasture to get a drink of nice cool water at the
trough by the pump.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sick to my stomach, Punch. Let&#8217;s go home,&#8221; said Judy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! You will feel better in a few minutes. You have been
eating too many of those luscious green cornstalks. They act on
goats just as too much candy acts on children. Go over and lie
down on that nice soft turf by the haystack. Keep in the warm
sun for a while and then if you do not feel better, I will take you
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said one of the other goats, &#8220;let&#8217;s go over with Judy and
tell stories. My legs ache from going up and down that hill so many
times carrying those cornstalks that I can scarcely stand. Besides, it
will not be so lonesome for her and she will forget she feels ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were all lying down in a wide circle around Judy, Jill,
one of Mrs. Spots&#8217; twins, said, &#8220;Now Punch, you tell the first story
for it will be an interesting one, &#8217;cause you can tell us one you have
heard from Grandfather Whiskers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, do!&#8221; exclaimed Jack, the other twin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied Punch. &#8220;I am tired of hearing him tell the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
same ones over and over again to the different animals that call.
You two tell stories instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we do not know any interesting ones!&#8221; they objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Punch, and tell them about the time Grandfather went
up in a hydroplane over the city of Rio de Janeiro in South
America,&#8221; urged Judy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do, do! That will be most exciting!&#8221; they all exclaimed.</p>

<p>So Punch began and their eyes were almost popping out of their
heads at the thrilling experiences he was relating when they were
nearly frightened out of their skins by a big cross dog running around
the barn and suddenly appearing before them. For a moment he
was as much surprised as they, for he had just come in with a farmer
and was exploring things, as he had never been on this farm before.
But in a minute he recovered himself and with a bark and a leap he
landed in their midst. Such a hurrying and a scurrying as there was!
Judy forgot she was ill and tried to climb up the haystack, steep as
it was, but fell over backward, landing on the dog, frightening one
as much as the other for a moment. On seeing the dog standing beside
Judy, Punch pitched on him, though he was afraid of big dogs.
But he had been taught he must always protect Judy, as she was a
girl. Now Punch had short baby horns, but they could hurt, and
the first thing this great dog knew, two sharp horns were running
into his side. He turned with a snarl, ready to bite whatever it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
that was hurting him so, when lo! at that second a red cow with long,
sharp horns came around the corner of the barn and seeing Punch
about to be attacked by a strange dog, she gave one jump forward and
the next thing that dog knew, he was going up in the air at the rate of
thirty-five miles an hour. He thought he was never coming down,
but at last he did, though to his dismay he landed on top of a shed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-043.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>One of the little white calves that had been listening to Punch&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
story was so panic-stricken that she fled, but instead of keeping her
eyes open to see where she was going, she shut them tight. The consequence
was she fell headfirst into a tub of red dye and when she
stood up she was no longer a snow-white calf but a brilliant red one.</p>

<p>Another calf was so frightened that she ran straight into the farmhouse
kitchen and fell down the cellar stairs. The cook, who heard
the commotion, came to see who was stamping around on her freshly
scrubbed floor. But she saw no one, though she did hear a groan of
pain down in the cellar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>No answer&mdash;just a groan came from below.</p>

<p>She peered down the stairs, but no one was visible in the pitch
black of the cellar. At last the cook gathered up courage enough to
light a candle and go down two or three steps.</p>

<p>On seeing the light, the calf was so frightened she forgot her pain
and went rushing around the cellar, stumbling over and upsetting
everything. All the cook saw was a big red monster with glaring
eyes. She dropped the candle in her fright and fled. Out the
kitchen door she went, loudly calling for help. In a jiffy Mr. Smith
and the farmer whose dog had made all this trouble came running
to discover the cause of the commotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something awful in the cellar! All hair and eyes! And
it is running around upsetting everything!&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;Wait until I get a pitchfork to drive it out, and I will see what
it is. Light a lantern for me,&#8221; Mr. Smith commanded.</p>

<p>With a pitchfork in one hand and a lantern in the other, Mr.
Smith started down the cellar stairs with the neighbor farmer close
behind him brandishing a long whip in one hand and holding his
dog by the collar with the other.</p>

<p>The dog quickly smelt the calf, gave a jerk and down the stairs he
bounded, knocking the lantern out of Mr. Smith&#8217;s hand, putting out
the light and smashing the chimney. Then the hubbub began. The
dog chased the calf around the cellar, giving her nips every once
in a while that made the poor frightened beast bellow. At last the
calf made for the stairs. Seeing a big red animal with blazing eyes
come out of the darkness, the two farmers turned and fled. But the
animal came after them, followed by the dog. When they were out
in the light of day, Mr. Smith saw it was only a calf, but a very
queer calf. By this time the calf was standing on the kitchen table
right in the midst of the luncheon dishes. She had been so terrified
by the dog that she had jumped on a chair and from there to the
table. The dog was barking furiously and trying to get up on the
table too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of here! You have made enough trouble for one day!&#8221;
and the farmer grabbed his dog by the collar and dragged him out.
Indeed, he literally had to drag him away from the calf. He whined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
and made a terrific fuss as he was dragged along, and it was only
by tying him to the back of the wagon that his owner took him away.</p>

<p>The moment the Twins saw the dog disappear into the house they
had cut sticks for home, and never stopped running until they came
to the pond where their father and mother and all the rest of the
Watson farm animals were standing in the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you all standing in the water for?&#8221; asked Punch.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are making ourselves clean for the party,&#8221; answered their
father. &#8220;But where have you been? You look as if you had been
standing in a lake too, you are so wet with perspiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we have been racing down the hill to see which could reach
here first,&#8221; easily replied Punch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you better lie down in the shade and cool off. Don&#8217;t you
dare come into this cold pond until you are perfectly dry. If you
do, both of you may have chills.&#8221;</p>

<p>So off the Twins walked and lay down under a tree to watch the
other animals. &#8220;My, Punch, but that was an awful scare! He
frightened me so I am still trembling,&#8221; confessed Judy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>THE &#8220;WELCOME HOME&#8221; PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-047.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">AT last it was nearly time to start for the party. The only
thing there was to wait for now was for Mr. and Mrs.
Watson to go to bed, as it would never do for the animals
to start and then have Mr. Watson come out to the
barn and discover them all gone.</p>

<p>To-night of all nights it seemed as if he would never turn out the
lights. All eyes in the barnyard were watching the living-room,
waiting for the lights there to be turned out and for those in the bedroom
to be switched on. The window shades were up and the animals
could see Mr. Watson comfortably seated in his big armchair
reading the evening paper, his wife near him busy with her knitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed one of the young heifers, &#8220;I am growing so nervous
waiting I could kick down the barn doors! It is such a glorious
evening I want to start early and stay late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said another cow, &#8220;he has gone out to the pump to get his
last glass of cold water before retiring, for I can hear the old pump
handle squeak. But oh, dear me, he is sitting down again! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
<i>never</i> does that! He always goes to bed directly after he drinks his
glass of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Mrs. Watson is holding up the sock she is knitting and she
is pointing to the toe. I believe she is asking him to wait until she
finishes it. Yes, that is surely what she has done, for he is taking up
his paper again,&#8221; remarked a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall just die,&#8221; said the young heifer, &#8220;if they do not soon go
to bed and let us get off. There are so many of us, why couldn&#8217;t
some of us go on ahead? Then if he comes out, there would be
plenty left and he would not miss those who have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was being discussed when oh, joy! the lights in the living-room
went out and those upstairs flashed on. A minute after that
the procession, Billy at its head, moved silently but quickly out of
the barnyard and down the hill to the little stream in the meadow
which they followed until it brought them to Mr. Smith&#8217;s farm as this
was the same little brook that wandered through Mr. Smith&#8217;s pasture
where the party was to be held.</p>

<p>First came Billy and Nannie, then Billy Junior and Daisy, and
then followed in pairs the pigs, sheep, young cattle, old cows and
horses last. In this way the shortest went first and each could see
over the heads of the animals in front of them. You never saw such
a clean, glossy lot of animals as every one of them had spent most of
the day in cleaning and shining their coats, either by taking a bath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
in the brook or rolling in the sand. Then to make themselves smell
sweet, they had rolled in the mint bed by the
stream or else crushed the sweet smelling garden
pinks that had boldly pushed their heads
through the garden fence.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-049.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>They had gone about half their way when in
the dim light they saw Farmer Jones&#8217; cattle
hurrying helter skelter in their direction, likewise
bound for the party. They were coming
in no regular order at all. First one would be
ahead and then another. And their coats
looked mussed and dirty. One white cow had
great chunks of mud clinging to her sides.</p>

<p>When the Jones cattle saw how beautifully
clean and spick and span the Watson animals
looked, they were so ashamed of their own appearance
that they felt like going home, and, in
fact, the white cow did go back and clean up,
arriving much later. She could not face the
glossy cattle while she was in such a mess.</p>

<p>The leader of the Jones cattle was an old, old
cow, and when she came up to Billy and saw
how fine his procession looked, she gave a deep sigh and said, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
never thought of asking my cattle to clean up or to form into a
procession, and here we come to the party looking just as we do
every day. My, oh my! I can&#8217;t tell you how mortified I feel! But
I assure you I never thought of cleaning up or of marching over in
a dignified way instead of all rushing along pell-mell. But then
you are young and up-to-date while I am old and set in my ways and
how I am going to look never enters my head. I guess I am too old
to be the leader of young stock and I shall resign my place to-morrow.
Do you think we would have time to clean up a bit before
we go to the party?&#8221; she inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly! There is lots of time. Just go down to the brook
and wade in it a little while and you will even then have ample
time to get to the party before it is late. We came early because
the younger cattle were so impatient to be off that I consented to
an early start,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much, Mr. Whiskers, for your kind advice. I
shall take it, and when we appear at the party at least we shall
have the dust and dirt washed out of our hair, even if we do not
shine like all of you. We won&#8217;t have time to let our hair dry
and lick it down. What is more, when we do arrive, we will
come in some sort of order, and not all helter skelter,&#8221; and she
walked off to issue instructions covering what she planned to do.</p>

<p>She really expected to have a great deal of trouble in persuading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
her cattle to stop to clean themselves. But not so; they were
every one glad to do so as they saw what a sorry sight they made
compared to Billy&#8217;s procession.</p>

<p>When Billy arrived, he took his stand beside Mr. and Mrs. Spots,
who were receiving under an old gnarled weeping willow tree beside
the stream. He then presented to Mr. and Mrs. Spots those
of his animals who had never met their host and hostess, after which
the procession broke rank and wandered at will in little groups,
mingling with the animals from the other farms. It was a very
large party&mdash;the largest by far ever given by animals in these parts.</p>

<p>About half an hour after Billy&#8217;s group arrived, the Jones cattle
came, and you never saw such a difference in appearance in the way
they looked now and in the meadow.</p>

<p>The animals were having a most enjoyable time when suddenly
they heard the most distressing baaing and groaning down in the
meadow, but coming nearer and nearer as if the animal was running.
As they listened, they could distinguish the words &#8220;Mama,
mama, save us, save us!&#8221; Daisy pricked up her ears and recognizing
the voices, she was off with a bound. Her husband followed,
and Billy Whiskers too.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ever can be the trouble?&#8221; said Nannie. &#8220;The Twins
wanted to come with us, but of course we would not permit that.
Probably they have followed us and been frightened by something.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>That is just what it proved to be. The Twins grew lonesome
after their father, mother, grandfather and grandmother and all
the farm animals had departed, so they decided to follow them but
keep out of sight when they reached the party. But when they were
in the meadow where the grass grew away over their heads, they
became frightened and were debating whether or not to go back
home when with a bound there came a wolf out of the tall grass.
Now if there is one thing a goat fears more than all else, it is a wolf.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-052.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The Twins let out a wild baa and began to run like mad toward
the party, where they knew they would gain safety. As they ran
they could feel the hot breath of the wolf and they were about to
drop in sheer fright and exhaustion from running and crying when
just before them they saw their grandfather, father and mother.
With one bound Billy was beside them, ready to kill the grey wolf
he saw close behind them. But when he looked a second time,
instead of a wolf, he saw a neighbor&#8217;s big grey dog. He was also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
coming to the party and the Twins in their fright had mistaken
him for a wolf.</p>

<p>Daisy was determined to take the Twins right back home, but
Mr. and Mrs. Spots insisted that she put them to bed with their
children in the stable, where they could sleep in safety until the
party was over. This was finally agreed upon, and when everything
was quiet again, Billy was asked to give them a talk about
his travels.</p>

<small>THE BRAZILIAN BULL FIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-055.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">AFTER the calling of &#8220;Speech! A speech from Billy
Whiskers!&#8221; had died down some, Billy climbed up to
a shelf of rock that protruded from the brow of a hill
overlooking the lower stretch of land where the party
was in progress. From this vantage point he could be seen and
heard by all. The moment he stepped forward and began to
speak, there was dead silence and not a horse or cow so much as
switched its tail to chase away the flies.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear friends, it gives me great pleasure to be back in your
midst once more, and to have the opportunity to see and speak to
you. My very dear and old friends, Mr. and Mrs. Spots, who
have made it possible for me to meet you all this evening, have
asked me to relate one or two of the experiences I had while away.
I can assure you I have had many thrilling ones. But instead of
telling you about them, I am going to describe one of the most
peculiar sights I saw while in South America.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you well know, wherever a country has been settled by the
Spanish or the Portuguese, there bull fights have been introduced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
as it is the national sport of those two countries. Consequently
when I was in Rio de Janeiro and heard people talking about going
to the bull fight on Sunday afternoon (they are always held on
Sunday) I decided to see what they were like, though I did not
relish the idea in the least as I dislike to see any kind of an animal
hurt or abused. You see I had heard that a bull fight is one of
the most cruel sports engaged in by any nation. Still I felt that
as long as I was in a country where they had them, I had better
go and see how they are conducted and what the people who attend
these fights look like. If I found it too cruel, I could come away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I followed the crowd going to the bull ring, and succeeded in
slipping in between the people and finding a good place away up
on the last tier of seats from which to witness the fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been there only a few minutes when with a blare of trumpets
a pair of double doors was thrown open and out rode a toreador
on a coal-black horse prancing in time to the music as he
champed his bit while his rider bowed low to the audience. Before
him as he pranced around the ring went two trumpeters
dressed in red velvet and silver lace, blaring away on their extra
long beribboned trumpets. As for the toreador, he was costumed
in black velvet and gold lace, and wore a three-cornered hat with
a long flowing white ostrich plume, and carried a long spear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
held upright. Behind him marched the picadores and matadores.</p>

<p>&#8220;After this company once circles the ring, it is the custom for the
toreador to take his place in the middle of the ring, facing the door
through which the bulls enter the ring from their partially darkened
stalls. The door from the stall into the ring is thrown wide
open and seeing the bright light, the bull rushes for it, so that when
he first enters the ring he is blinded by the sudden glare, and he
stands, head erect, looking in all directions, puzzled which way to
turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first bull to enter on the day I was there was a magnificent
jet black beast with long, pointed horns, though the points had
been sawed off, as that is the law in Brazil. Also no horse or bull
may be killed or injured. The toreador, picadores and matadores
are there to protect the horse and to keep him from being disemboweled
or injured in any way. They are permitted to tease
the bull and throw long darts into the bull but not to injure him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I found this out I was delighted for now I could enjoy
watching the fight and let my nerves quiet down.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as the bull&#8217;s eyes were accustomed to the light, he spied
the toreador on the horse facing him, and with a snort he began
to paw the dirt and switch his tail. He charged on horse and man
but he was not quick enough. The horse jumped to one side and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the toreador threw a dart that sank into the bull&#8217;s hind quarter.
With a quick turn the bull was after them again and for some little
time they chased each other here, there and everywhere around the
ring until the toreador had thrown another dart into him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-058.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;While the toreador was trying to make the darts stick in the
bull&#8217;s shoulders or haunches, the
picadores teased him by shaking a red
cape in his face or else throwing it in
front of him just when he was about to gore the horse. The bull
took after the picadores and they had to run for safety, jumping
over a medium high wall that surrounded the whole ring, and
formed a very narrow passageway. It was built just high enough
for a bull that is a good jumper to get over, but the passageway was
so narrow that if he went over straight, there was not sufficient room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
for the bull. This bull hung over the wall until he could twist himself
straight, which delay gave the picadores time to escape and they
returned to the ring. This happened many times that day and made
the audience howl with delight and clap their hands. As soon as
the bull would get himself straightened out, he would run around
the enclosure until he came to an open door, and running through it
he would find himself in the ring once again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-059.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;This performance continued with each bull until he would have
two darts sticking in him and then another bull was brought on,
and this one was led out by six cream-colored oxen with humps on
their backs like water buffalo have. These oxen were trained to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
walk over to where the bull stood and quietly encircle him, so
that he walked out in the midst of friends.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-061.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;As many as eight or nine bulls were used in that one afternoon.
Some of them would not fight at all, even though stuck with sharp
darts and annoyed in every imaginable way. When one refused
to fight, it was led out by the cream-colored oxen and another bull
brought in.</p>



<p>&#8220;The performance was concluded with a kind of burlesque show
such as one might see at a circus. Two men dressed in suits made
of thick rubber like automobile tires came into the ring. They
were so clumsy in their suits they could scarcely waddle, and when
a bull knocked them over, he could not hurt them. When they
fell and he rolled them around, they simply pulled their heads into
the suits much as a tortoise pulls its head into its shell, and let the
bull maul them until he was driven off by the picadores. Then
the picadores would help them to their feet as their suits made
them so clumsy they could not get up if once they fell down.</p>

<p>&#8220;These men made the bulls furious. They bellowed and
stamped and swished their tails with anger, all of which tickled
the crowd immensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing they had that greatly pleased the audience was
a paper ship under full sail. Four men got inside the ship and
carried it around. It was a comical sight as the men&#8217;s legs showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
below the ship where the water ought to be. They stood where
the bull would see the ship the first thing on entering
the ring. At first the bull was so astonished
he simply stood still and stared at them.
Then with a swish of his tail, he made for it at
full speed. A single onslaught shattered it and
there was a grand melee of bull, men&#8217;s legs, sails
and splinters. The bull was all tangled up in the
sails, and while he was trying to extricate himself,
a man on stilts and dressed in a long Mother Hubbard
and wearing a false face of Mother Hubbard
and that good lady&#8217;s bonnet walked into the ring.
For a while Mother Hubbard dodged the bull
cleverly, but at last she stumbled and fell across the
bull&#8217;s back. When the bull finally freed himself of
his burden, the false face with the bonnet was still
sticking between his horns, the dress and stilts trailing
across his broad back, while the man impersonating
Mother Hubbard was running for shelter back into
the bull shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was the last performance of the day and it
sent the crowd home laughing instead of horrified as a real bull
fight would have done. And I for one say that all bull fights should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
be like this one and no government should be permitted to hold such
cruel and horrible ones as are given in Spanish countries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy bowed low in conclusion and was about to leave the jutting
rock he had used as a platform when the crowd of animals below
cried, &#8220;Tell us something more! Tell us something more! We
never travel nor see anything of the world, and it will be the greatest
treat for us if you will tell us what you saw and did.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Billy walked back to his place and proceeded to relate how
he had personified King Neptune.</p>

<small>BILLY PERSONIFIES NEPTUNE</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-063.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THIS adventure took place while I was on the good ship
<i>Vandyck</i> bound for South America,&#8221; began Billy.
&#8220;As the ship neared the equator, there was great excitement
on board for a fancy dress ball was being planned
to welcome King Neptune when he boarded the ship as we glided
over the equator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those of the passengers who had brought no fancy costumes with
them had to improvise them out of things they had and by the help
of borrowed finery, for at such a time travelers are more than willing
to loan anything they possess to help piece out the costume of a
fellow-passenger. Especially was this true on board the <i>Vandyck</i>,
as prizes were to be given for the best costume made on board, and
another for the costume truest to type, while honorable mention was
promised to that person wearing the handsomest costume.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ball was at its height when the ship&#8217;s bells rang out the hour
of midnight, the dance was stopped and all eyes were turned toward
the side of the ship over which Neptune was to appear and claim
his throne. Then all the passengers were to walk before him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
be presented by the court officials dressed in full court regalia.
After the presentation, games were to be played and feats of skill
performed before King Neptune for his amusement, after which
refreshments were to be served and the gayety and dancing kept up
until very late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Generally one of the ship&#8217;s officers takes the part of Neptune,
for you must know this ball is held on every trip the ship makes to
South America. And very fine does he look with snow-white hair
and flowing beard and long purple velvet robe with its ermine cape,
to say nothing of the golden crown and all the other regalia of a
really truly king, even to the golden staff tipped with Neptune&#8217;s
trident.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-064b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SEEING MR. ROBINSON DANGLING THERE, BILLY GAVE HIM A MIGHTY<br />
BUTT THAT SHOVED HIM ALL THE WAY THROUGH.<br />

<span class="illoindent">(<span class="smcap">Page <a href="#Page_95">95</a></span>)</span></p>


<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-065.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;But on this trip the officers had conceived the idea of dressing
me up as king and seating me on the throne, as I have been trained
to sit up and hold my fore legs down like arms. So the night the
ball was in progress, the officers seated me on the throne while the
guests were dancing. Once seated, they hurriedly draped the royal
purple robe around me, fitted the golden crown on my head to hide
my horns, tied the staff to my left leg which I rested on the arm of
the golden chair of state, stuck a monocle in one eye, and as the
ship&#8217;s bells ceased ringing at midnight, a page with a silver trumpet
marched to the side of the ship where the guests were dancing and
led the way to King Neptune&#8217;s throne, where they were presented.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
When the passengers raised their heads after the deep ceremonial
bow of presentation, each one was impressed by a weirdness in King
Neptune&#8217;s appearance. The more they gazed, the more pronounced
was the strangeness. What
could it be? There was the
long white hair and
beard, but the eyes
had a peculiar
twinkle in them
and the nose
was exceedingly
broad. Why did
the king look so
different from all
other times they had
seen him? This was
Neptune. Yet it was not
the Neptune they had expected
to see. But they could not tarry in front of him and stare
while in a procession, for after their ceremonial bow they must
move on, giving place to others.</p>



<p>&#8220;Once they had passed by the throne, the passengers quickly
gathered in groups to discuss the queer looking Neptune. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
one had been presented when a great clatter was heard. Neptune
had dropped his staff, and the next thing they knew, they were gazing
at the unusual spectacle
of a king running
on all fours from his
throne, and as they
looked, they saw
him approach the
side of the ship
and plunge over
its side.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-066.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;It was not the ocean into
which I, King Neptune, leaped but
only the swimming tank at the ship&#8217;s
side, just under the promenade deck,
but they said afterward it looked exactly
as if the king had jumped into the ocean.
Every one ran to that side of the ship,
expecting to see the king rising and falling
on the billows but no king could they see. Had
they watched the swimming tank, they would have seen a goat being
divested of his robes and crown by five or six sailors who were trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
to save me from drowning, as I had become so entangled in my
robes I could not swim. All the while the sailors were trying to
keep me from drowning, other sailors were letting out the water
as fast as it could be drained from the tank.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was some time before the excited passengers could return to
their dancing and march before the judges but it was finally accomplished.
They decided that the prettiest costume was worn by
a sweet young girl representing a pink rosebud. The overskirts of
her dress formed the petals of the rose, and she wore a wreath of
buds in her sunny gold hair. The most handsome costume was that
of a tall, stately brunette who appeared as the Queen of Sheba.
Her garments had been brought from Egypt. The best outfit
made from things picked up on board was a Turkish lady of the
harem. She wore changeable yellow silk bloomers loaned by one
of the ladies coming back from Turkey. Over them she wore a
rainbow tinted scarf tied as a sash, with a crimson velvet jacket over
a blouse with flowing white silk sleeves embroidered in gold, while
over her head was thrown a pale silver-blue veil, thin and airy as a
cloud, held in place by a gold band worn low on her forehead. On
neck, wrists and ankles tinkled gold coins, while on her feet she wore
bright red morocco slippers with sharp-pointed toes. She made a
perfect favorite of the harem. The most original costume was
fashioned entirely of newspapers and was called &#8216;current events.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;They said the only drawback to the whole evening&#8217;s performance
was the loss of Neptune&#8217;s robe which I had ruined by jumping
into the water. But when the passengers found out that it was their
old pet Billy Whiskers who had impersonated King Neptune, they
thought it was so clever of me to sit on the throne for so long decked
out in all that finery that they did not blame me for running away.
They took up a collection to buy a new robe in the place of the one
the water had ruined, and so, my friends, no harm came of the
unusual evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I went down below to my quarters where all the animals
belonging to the passengers were kept, they gathered around me to
hear what had taken place.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tell you what, Bill,&#8217; said an English bulldog, &#8216;you did make a
bully good looking king. Really in your royal robes you did not
look unlike King George&mdash;and I have seen King George and know
what I am talking about.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But what made you jump into the swimming tank?&#8217; asked a
French poodle.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For the moment I forgot it was there,&#8217; I explained, &#8216;and I ached
so from sitting up so long that I thought my back would break.
Then, too, the crown was cutting into my head, and I was half
smothered with that fur cape and all the rest of the things I wore.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is a good thing we saw them dress you up in the afternoon to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
find how the things were going to fit you,&#8217; said another dog, &#8216;or we
would never have gotten a peep at you, for they shut us in at sundown
and you did not appear until midnight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the whole story,&#8221; concluded Billy, bowing left and right,
and stepping down from the rocky ledge he had used as a platform.</p>

<p>Now it was Stubby&#8217;s turn to tell of his experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>STUBBY RELATES HIS EXPERIENCE WITH SEALS</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-071.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">STUBBY looked only as big as a minute as he mounted
the rock to recount his experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most thrilling and exciting adventure I had
while we were in California was at the Catalina Islands,
where we went to ride in the glass-bottomed rowboats they
have there so people may see the bottom of the ocean and get a peek
at the sea feathers, coral, flowers and fish. What one sees through
the clear water is most beautiful. Little hills and hollows of the
purest yellow or white sand, with long, dull pink swaying plants
resembling ostrich plumes growing out of it. Next to them there
may be bright yellow fan-shaped plants around the roots of which is
white and pink coral exactly the shape of a man&#8217;s brains, or else in
the form of sprays. And from these same mounds of glistening
golden sand will bloom the delicate waxy sea anemones. Oh, it is
most enchanting, and one expects to see a mermaid glide through
this sea garden along with the gold, blue and silver fish that swim
among these plants as our birds fly through our trees.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;Then if one wishes to row out about a mile where the water is
so deep the bottom cannot be seen, they find the shoals of bluefish.
That is a wonderful treat, for here they will see hundreds of young
bluefish from six to twelve inches long, all facing in the same direction,
apparently resting on the long-stemmed plants that grow
up from the bottom of the ocean and have little yellow balloons
on the stems to keep them from falling back. This is one of the feeding
places of the bluefish where they stay when the tide is running out
and eat the particles of sea food it washes out to them. All the fish
face one way, there being tiers of fish, one on top of the other, with
only a few inches between each tier as far down in the ocean as one
can see.</p>

<p>&#8220;The queerest part of it is that they keep their fins moving in and
out but do not move or swim about at all. They are as blue as the
bluest sky you ever saw and they make a wonderfully beautiful
picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;As one approaches these bluefish banks, as they are called, the
reflection of their color makes the water above them turn a dark
shade so the fishermen can tell by the color of the water where they
are feeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will say there is nothing thrilling about this peaceful scene,&#8221;
said Stubby. &#8220;But wait! I am coming to that. I just had to tell
you about this most exquisite sight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Well, when we came back from our ride in the little rowboat, a
man on the dock was calling out, &#8216;Right this way for the glass-bottomed
steamer that takes you to the Seal Rocks! You see the
seals at home and the way they live. All the way there you can gaze
through the glass bottom and see the wonderful Sea Garden. At a
point where it is most beautiful a man in a diver&#8217;s suit will enter
the water and bring to you any flower or shell you may wish. Starting
in ten minutes, returning in one hour for the small price of one
dollar. Don&#8217;t miss seeing this wonder garden of the deep!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It all sounded good to me, so I went on board and prepared to
gaze at the same beauties I had seen in the rowboat, but when we
started I was very much disappointed to see instead of the exquisitely
colored fish, flowers and swaying plants just a few unattractive
shells, and no flowers or feathers at all. And when the diver went
overboard there was nothing attractive for him to get to bring back.
I heard one of the passengers say that he had taken this trip years
ago and that then there were sea feathers and plants and coral but
that all the years people had been carrying them away until now
scarcely anything was left. What we did see were put there from
time to time, so the diver could have something to bring the people,
charging twenty-five cents for each piece he brought. So I stopped
gazing through the glass bottom and went to the side of the boat
where I could watch the antics of a mother seal and two or three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
others. The boat seemed to make them very angry, and the mother
seal appeared to be trying to stop it or frighten it away, for she kept
up a constant crying and approached nearer and nearer the boat as if
she wished to bite it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-074.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I heard the captain tell a lady the seal made such a fuss because
she was trying to frighten the boat so it would not go to her home
on Seal Rock; that possibly she had a baby there that she had left
behind while she went out to look for food.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-076.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;When we round that point you see ahead, you will hear the
most awful racket set up for all the seals will begin to bark. The
males will dive and leap out of the water and come toward us, swimming
round and round the ship and under us all the time we are at
the Rocks, for this is where they live and breed. Do you see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
big, dark object on the top of that large rock projecting out into the
sea? Well, watch it closely and you will see it is a seal. He is
their leader and he always stays out there where he can catch the
first glimpse of any intruder and give the alarm. He is by far the
oldest and largest seal in these waters. There are now many young
seals on the island, which makes him more fierce than usual for the
male seals look after their families well and try to protect them
from all danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There, he has spied us and given alarm! When we turn that
point of land he is on we will be facing a curved rocky beach and
on those rocks you will see hundreds and hundreds of seals of all
ages and colors, for the baby seals are cream colored, while the older
seals have dark brown coats.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;True to all the captain said, the moment we rounded the point,
one would have thought bedlam had been turned loose, for every
seal was barking&mdash;the old seals loudly and fiercely, the baby seals
with mere squeaks.</p>



<p>&#8220;I left the captain and went to the side of the ship to watch the
seals slip off the high rocks into the water and come toward us with
that peculiar gliding motion seals alone have. In a few minutes
there were hundreds of them around our boat. I was standing by a
little eight-year-old boy, my fore paws on the rail of the boat, when,
horror of horrors! I felt him give me a push and into that seething<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
mass of angry seals I went head first. I thought my time had come,
and that I would be eaten alive, the seals looked so fierce. They
swam under me, tossing me three or four feet up in the air. They
swam over me, sending me almost to
the very bottom of the ocean. Then
again they would swim around me,
twirling me around so fast it made my
head swim. Every minute I expected
to have them bite me. When I
came to the surface after one of
those times when they had
pushed me down to the bottom,
I heard the boat&#8217;s whistle
tooting like mad and I realized
that the captain was doing it to
frighten the seals away. It served the purpose, too, for it did that
very thing, every one of the seals quickly making for the shore. As
soon as they had left me, I swam toward the boat and the captain
lowered a bushel basket tied to a rope for me to crawl in, which I
did and then a sailor pulled me quickly to the deck. Since that day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
I have never wanted to see a seal and when I chance to walk through
a park and hear them barking, it makes the cold shivers run up and
down my spine to think what I endured while those seals were surrounding
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubby&#8217;s experience pleased the crowd greatly, and they showed
their appreciation by stamping their feet on the ground and bellowing,
grunting, barking, meowing, baaing and bleating.</p>

<p>Amidst this applause Stubby left the platform.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>BUTTON IS SPEAKER</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-079.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">AFTER Stubby had spoken, it was Button&#8217;s turn to tell
what had befallen him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you animals will excuse me, I shall be greatly
obliged, as I am no speaker and nothing of interest has
happened to me for a long time,&#8221; he said.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-080.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there has! I know there has!&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;Go ahead
and tell them what happened to you at the Barbados!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do,&#8221; Stubby agreed. &#8220;That <i>was</i> an extremely exciting
experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Button mounted the rocky ledge and began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our ship had anchored about two miles out in the roadstead,
and everyone was on deck waiting for the little rowboats to come to
take them ashore. The water is not deep enough at the wharf for
sea-going vessels to dock. As they waited, the passengers were
hanging over the rail watching the little negro boys dive for coins
down into the deep, deep waters where sharks and swordfish lurk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
awaiting a chance to bite off an arm or leg or run a long sword into
the body of an unwary swimmer.</p>



<p>&#8220;A man and his wife in a rowboat came up close to the ship to
display their wares. They had a lovely parrot in one
cage and another full of red, yellow and vari-colored
birds for sale, and also jewelry cleverly fashioned out
of shells, and handbags made of the brown, glossy reeds
of a plant that grows on the island. I
was watching the
pair when quick
as a wink a man
pushed me off the
ship&#8217;s rail where
I was curled up
to view all that
went on beneath
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;My surprise
was so great when I found myself falling from the height of the
promenade deck that I could not think, and when I landed in the
woman&#8217;s lap in the rowboat, I would have leaped overboard had
she not held on to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;The man who had pushed me overboard called out, &#8216;The cat for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
a parrot! That cat is a valuable one but I will part with him for
your talking parrot.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;To his surprise, the woman quickly agreed to the trade and tied
the parrot&#8217;s cage to a rope that was let down. The cage had just
reached the deck level and the man was untying it when I spied it
as it was loosened and swung in the woman&#8217;s lap. With a bound I
grabbed it and began to climb up. The woman&#8217;s husband stretched
out his hand to stop me but he was too late. I had climbed too high
for him to reach me and in trying to do so he came near upsetting his
boat with all his wares and his wife in it. Indeed, had it not been
for the woman&#8217;s presence of mind to throw her whole weight to the
opposite side of the boat, it would surely have capsized.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I reached the top of the rope, the man who had thrown me
overboard tried to prevent me from coming on deck by pushing my
head back. But at last I wearied of having him treat me so, and the
next time he touched me I reached out one paw and gave him a
scratch that quickly made him let go the rope. While he was
nursing his hand and too engrossed with the pain to think of what I
was doing, I jumped aboard and ran into the saloon. As I went, I
heard the boatman and his wife calling loudly to the man on board
to send back their parrot or pay them for it. After tormenting them
for some time by pretending he was going to keep the parrot, he
wrapped some money in a paper and threw it into their boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-080a.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p class="caption">BILLY SURPRISED AUGUSTA BY BUTTING HER RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD,<br />
AND SHE LANDED IN THE TROUGH WITH A GREAT SPLASH.<br />

<span class="illoindent">(<span class="smcap">Page</span> <a href="#Page_113">113</a>)</span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;I considered it a narrow escape for I would not have lived with
that couple for worlds. There is no country, no matter how beautiful,
where I have ever been or about which I have ever heard
in which I should like to live but the United States of America.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, as time went on, the man who bought the parrot neglected
her so, forgetting to feed her and give her water to drink and for
her bath that I felt sorry for her and I told her that when we stopped
at the Island of Trinidad I would open her cage door and let her
out if she thought she could fly ashore and take care of herself after
she had gained land.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-082.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Of course I can, for my wings have never been clipped and on
that island grows every kind of food I need, just as in the Barbados.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Very well, then, I will open your cage door and free you,&#8217; I
promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consequently when we reached Trinidad, I wiggled and fussed
with her cage door until I succeeded in opening it. Then I had the
pleasure of seeing her fly for the shore, where she alighted on the
top of a tall cocoanut palm tree. How I did enjoy her owner&#8217;s discomfiture
when he discovered she was gone! He made a great fuss
and said his bird had been stolen and insisted the entire ship be
searched for her, though one of the sailors said he had seen a green
parrot fly to shore shortly after we had landed. He declared parrots
are clever birds and said she probably loosed the door with her bill
and squeezed herself out, as he had seen them do that trick before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd cheered and cheered in the usual way and said they
wished Button would tell them another experience. But he hurried
off the rock platform and lost himself in the crowd so they could
not press him to tell another.</p>

<small>BILLY RUNS AWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-085.jpg"  alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ALL the next day the animals and fowls too listened with
all their ears to discover whether or not Mr. Watson
or any of the farm hands knew they had been away at
a party the night before. But not a word was spoken
about it so they decided no one thought they had been off the farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, didn&#8217;t we have a good time? One to be remembered all
our lives! And Father Billy&#8217;s talk was most entertaining,&#8221; said
Daisy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly did, and the Chums related such thrilling things
that it would almost pay to let them go traveling again so they
could have some more unusual experiences to relate when they came
home,&#8221; agreed her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hi there, Billy Whiskers, where are you?&#8221; called Mr. Watson.
&#8220;I want you to pull Ruthie to town in the little goat cart.
She is going in to spend the day with some little friends, and they
wish to have a ride in her cart.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>So the new harness with all the shining silver buckles on it was
put on Billy and he was hitched to the cunning little cart and away
drove Ruthie, Mr. Watson&#8217;s little four-year-old granddaughter who
had come to the farm for a visit with her mother, the only daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Watson.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-086.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Billy trotted along the road almost as fast as a pony would go,
for the cart and Ruthie were a light burden for such a big, strong
goat, and it was no time until they were in town. Of course Mr.
Watson drove a little way behind them so he could be ready to
take a hand should any accident occur in case they met a drove
of cattle, for he did not know what Billy might do in such an
emergency.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>The first thing they did on coming to the town was to go straight
to the home of Grace, the little girl Ruthie was to visit. There
they piled into the cart all the children the little wagon could hold,
and took them for a nice long ride around town, returning just before
luncheon. Before they went into the house they unhitched
Billy and gave him just what he liked best to eat: carrots and a
bunch of sweet hay with a big pail of cold well water to drink.
Then they left him to wander around in the big yard as he pleased,
taking care that all the gates were tightly shut before they left him.</p>

<p>Billy ate his dinner which he enjoyed greatly, being extremely
hungry after pulling the children all about the town. After he
had eaten, he sought the shade of a big tree and took a nap. He
awoke feeling very much refreshed and hearing the children
laughing at their play on the other side of the house, he thought
this would be a good time to run off and hide before they tired of
the swing and came for him to take them for another ride. This
he had determined he would not do, having ahead of him the long
pull to take Ruthie back to the farm.</p>

<p>As you know, gates were nothing to Billy when he wished to go
somewhere, as he could jump any gate he ever saw. With a bound
now he was over one and out on the street, running as fast as ever
he could go toward Lake Winnebago which he could see rippling
in the distance.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-089a.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>On his arrival at the shore of the lake, feeling hot and dusty
from pulling the little cart around during the morning, he decided
to go for a swim. This he enjoyed, coming out greatly refreshed
and rested. While he was shaking himself dry, up the beach he
spied a queer looking object. He could not make out what it was,
so he determined to run up and find out. He had almost reached
the spot when something glided on top of the water for a short distance
and then rose from the surface and flew for quite a distance
as straight up in the air as ever it could go. Then it descended
in graceful curves to the water, and again made a flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho! They are hydroplanes!&#8221; exclaimed Billy. &#8220;My, how
I wish I could get a ride in one! I know I should just love the
sensation of gliding on the water and then flying straight up in the
air. I think I shall go as close as I can to them and see what they
look like at close range.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he arrived and saw one after the other of the planes make
a flight, he was more anxious than ever to ride in one. At last he
was so near he could have stepped off the platform one plane was
lying against, and in fact was about to do so and take all chances
when some boys discovered him and began to throw stones at him.
He paid no attention to them, but thought how cruel and selfish
boys could be to throw stones at him when he was not bothering
anyone, only looking at the fascinating planes just as they were.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
But when they sicked two dogs on him, he
knew he would have to go. They chased
him to the end of the pier. He could go
no farther unless he jumped into the
water. Then when one of the dogs snapped
at him, he turned to his tormentor and hooked him
straight up in the air, and he came down inside one of the
hydroplanes just as it was rising from the water, carrying
him up with it. The dog was so afraid in the plane that
he jumped out when they were about fifty feet in the air, and
went kersplash in the water, disappearing from sight and probably
touching the very bottom of the lake. When he came to the
surface he swam for shore and, reaching it, cut sticks for home as
fast as his long legs would carry him.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-089b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>On seeing what had happened to his friend,
the second dog slunk off and disappeared from
sight, no one knew where.</p>



<p>Then some rough boys and men thought they
would have some fun with Billy and walked
out to the end of the pier to tease him, but
after the first man had been butted into the
lake, the others thought they would not try
it. Seeing there was too large a crowd gathered on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
shore for him to make his way through it, Billy Whiskers leaped
into the water, swimming near the shore until he was so far away
that the crowd would not bother him any more. He landed and
tried to find his way back to the house where Ruthie was visiting,
for he knew by the position of the sun he must have been away a long
time. But the more he tried to find the house, the more confused
he grew. Billy Whiskers knew he was lost.</p>

<p>He ran up and down the streets, baaing as loudly as he could,
hoping he might happen to pass the house and Ruthie would run
out and bring him in. But no such luck attended him and his
baaing only attracted the attention of the mischievous boys, who
threw stones after him or chased him up and down one street after
another. He had just escaped one group of boys and was quietly
walking down a street, trying to recover his breath, when he heard
the voices of several children in a yard the other side of a high
stone wall. He thought he recognized Ruthie&#8217;s voice, and ran to
the gate and peeped in, but no, to his disappointment all the children
were boys. They were acting so queerly he stopped to watch
them for a minute or two, and then he discovered they were trying
to do the tricks they had seen the clowns and trapeze performers
do at the circus. He was so busy gazing at them that he pushed
the gate open and went inside that he might have a close view
of the hand springs and backward somersaults they were turning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>AN EXCITING DAY FOR BILLY</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-091.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">AS Billy stood watching the antics of the boys, a bumble
bee began buzzing around his head, bothering him by
darting in and out of his ears. He shook his head and
tried also to paw it away, but it still persisted in humming
around and darting at him.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-092.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Say, you old buzzer, if you don&#8217;t keep away from me, I&#8217;ll swallow
you alive,&#8221; threatened Billy.</p>



<p>Just then the bee made a dive for his nose, but Billy opened
his mouth and swallowed it. But not before the bee had
stung his tongue. The pain was terrific, and Billy jumped
about as if he had suddenly gone crazy. He stood on his
head, rolled in the grass, wheeled round and round on his hind
legs and pawed the air with his fore feet, all the while bleating
pitifully.</p>

<p>Seeing the goat carrying on in this way, the boys thought he was
trying to mimic them, which made them laugh so they could not
stand up, for of course they did not know he had been stung. Alas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
for them! Billy thought they were making sport of his pain, and
with a single bound he was upon them, glad of a chance to hurt
something as he was being hurt. He kicked, butted and pawed
them until he had sent one boy over the fence into the alley, and
another was doubled up with his hands
over his stomach. Two boys
escaped, but the fifth ran toward
the kitchen door, Billy in
hot pursuit.</p>



<p>The boy had slammed the
door in Billy&#8217;s face and was
running through the
house when Billy butted
a big hole straight
through the screen door. This
brought the goat up behind a
big, fat cook who had her
hands in bread dough. Before she knew what had happened, she
felt herself falling backward. To save herself, she grabbed at the
bread pan. Of course it slid off the table and she fell on the floor.
The bread pan turned upside down over Billy&#8217;s horns, and the
sticky mass of dough went trickling down over one eye and on down
over his nose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>The cook&#8217;s screams brought the master of the house from his
study to the kitchen, but on arriving at the doorway he was met
by an infuriated goat who lowered his head to butt him. On seeing
such an adversary, the master made haste to retreat and quickly
put the dining table between them. But he was not quite nimble
enough for Billy was close on his heels and the chase was on.</p>

<p>Round and round that table they ran, with Billy gaining at
every step, Mr. Robinson calling loudly for help. Bridget had
collected her wits by this time and came to his rescue with a broom
and every time Billy passed her on his way around the table after
Mr. Robinson, she gave him a whack with it. Billy paid not the
slightest attention to her, as he was much too intent on overtaking
Mr. Robinson and giving him one mighty butt. In an ill-fated
moment Mr. Robinson&#8217;s foot slipped as he rounded one end of
the table. He grabbed the table runner to save himself, but that
did no good. He fell on one knee, and the table runner carried with
it vase, flowers and all, which came tumbling to the floor just in
time to fall on Billy&#8217;s head. It hurt him not at all, but really did
him a good turn as it washed the sticky dough from his horns and
eyes, for which he was truly thankful.</p>

<p>This little delay gave Mr. Robinson time to pick himself up and
escape through the hall and up the front stairs, which he took two
at a time. He rushed to his wife&#8217;s room, expecting to find the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
unlocked, but alas, it was bolted and he heard his wife calling,
&#8220;Help! Help! Burglars!&#8221; out of the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mary, Mary!&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;Let me in! Unbolt the
door! It is I, your husband!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was too frightened to
recognize his voice, and would
not leave the window through
which she was leaning to call for
help.</p>

<p>Now the door to her room had
an extra large transom over it,
plenty large enough for a person
to climb through, and Mr. Robinson
grabbed a stool in the
hallway, pushed it under the
transom and succeeded in
raising himself up on the
ledge of the door where he
hung balancing himself on
his stomach when he
heard Billy come clattering up the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary, Mary, open the door quickly! Stop that calling! Don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
you hear me? It is I, your husband!&#8221; he shouted at her
again.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-094.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>But his wife only saw a man climbing through her transom and
thought it was one of the burglars she had heard downstairs, and
leaned still further out of the window in an attempt to see someone
coming along the street. She lost her balance and fell head
first out of the window, but as luck would have it, she landed in a
soft flower bed, and the window not being so very far from the
ground, the fall did not injure her in the least.</p>

<p>At the moment she fell, Billy reached the head of the stairs.
Seeing Mr. Robinson dangling there, half in and half out, he
jumped on the stool and gave him a mighty butt that shoved him
all the way through, and he landed on the floor of his wife&#8217;s room
all in a heap. In a moment he was on his feet and rushed to the
window to see if his wife had been killed by her fall, forgetting
all about Billy in his anxiety about his wife.</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s prey having thus escaped him, and hearing footsteps on
the stairs, he knew somebody was answering Mrs. Robinson&#8217;s cries
for help. He ran down the long hall, hoping to find a back stairway,
for he well knew if he was caught by the police or whoever
it was coming to the rescue, they would club him. He was in
luck, for he came to a pair of stairs leading straight down to an
outside back porch. And in a jiffy he was out in the alley, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
for dear life, trying to put as much distance between himself and
the Robinson house as he could.</p>

<p>All this time his tongue was half killing him with pain, and it
was now so swollen he could not close his mouth. He was wild
for a drink of water. He remembered he had seen a lovely sparkling
fountain, and he was increasing his speed so he would reach
it quickly when he heard a noise behind him that sounded like a
patrol wagon coming lickety-split down the street. However, it
proved to be just a truck full of men, and Billy thought, &#8220;I have
no fear of <i>them</i>,&#8221; when suddenly the truck stopped as it was about
to pass him, and one of the men exclaimed, &#8220;There he is now! The
very goat we are looking for!&#8221; and two fellows leaped out after
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Billy to himself, and he kicked up his
heels and sped down the street and around the corner of the alley.
The men ran after him as fast as ever they could and the truck
followed but when they reached the corner, no goat was in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drat that old rascal! He is hiding somewhere! But where
I can&#8217;t imagine as all I see are high back yard walls and fences,
with not an open gate any place,&#8221; said one of the men.</p>

<p>Just then three shrill screams rent the air about half way down
the alley. The men knew immediately that Billy must have run
into a yard and frightened some woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>They were right in this surmise. Being a good jumper, Billy
had leaped over a wall and landed in a beautiful garden where a
hammock was swung between two trees. A lovely young lady lay
in it, reading a book and eating fruit. On seeing a big, white goat
leap over the fence and come straight towards her, she tried to
get out of the hammock. But you know what a hammock is when
you try to get out of one in a hurry? It simply turned upside
down and she was in a heap on the grass, with fruit, pillows and
book all about her, and she began to scream and call for help.</p>

<p>Billy grabbed a pear and trotted on through the yard. At that
second a big touring car was backed out of the garage by a chauffeur,
and being fond of riding in any kind of an automobile, Billy
ran across the lawn and with one bound was in the tonneau. This
so surprised the chauffeur that instead of stopping the car, he
stepped on the accelerator and the car shot out to the street at forty
miles an hour. The moment they were leaving in this manner,
three men climbed over the back wall, one ran after the car and the
goat and the other two went to the aid of the young woman who was
still pleading for aid at the top of her voice. She had rolled around in
trying to regain her feet so that instead of freeing herself, she had
wound herself up in hammock and pillows until she was helpless.
The men quickly had her on her feet and then they all ran to the
front yard to discover what had become of the car and Billy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Far down the street they could see a large crowd had gathered
and they hurried along, sure it must be caused by a wreck of the
car in which Billy rode.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until I tell our truck driver to come around on the street
and pick us up,&#8221; said one of the men as they ran. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get
there that way quicker than by foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>What really had happened was this:</p>

<p>When the chauffeur came to his senses, he tried to slow down but
he did not do so quickly enough and at a cross street he collided
with a milk wagon, upsetting it and spilling out all the milk cans.
The impact threw the chauffeur out of his car and stunned him
for a minute. The truck carrying the men came up just then, they
picked him up and put him in the truck, while one of them drove
the auto back to the garage. No harm was done the car with the
exception of scraping off a little paint, and, forgetting the loss of
milk, the milk wagon suffered not at all. And now where was
the cause of all this commotion, Mr. Billy Whiskers?</p>

<p>He was quietly drinking water from a crystal fountain in some
private grounds, and I am glad to say that the swelling of his
tongue was fast going down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy! I believe I am tired! Guess I&#8217;ll just go over under
those bushes and take a nap,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>This he did, but he slept much longer than he had intended, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
when he awoke the sun was going down, and he decided to try to
find Ruthie once more. He had just stepped out into the street,
when who should he see driving down his way but Mr. Watson
with Ruthie on his lap. They had hunted and hunted for Billy
with no success at all and had finally decided to go home without
the goat, getting the cart some other day. They were as glad to
see Billy as Billy was to see them. Mr. Watson stepped out of his
buggy and tied Billy under it, then driving slowly, they went home
to the farm.</p>

<p>Thus ended a very exciting day for Billy.</p>

<small>THE TWINS ARE STOLEN</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-101.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the forenoon of the next day Billy, Nannie, Daisy and
Billy Junior were under the big elm tree in the barnyard
listening to Billy describe all that had happened
to him the day before while he was in town, when
Stubby came running down the lane. On reaching them he panted
out this message:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where the Twins are while you are all chatting
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought they were down by the stream playing&#8221;, answered
Daisy, their mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they are being carried off to Milwaukee in a butcher&#8217;s
wagon!&#8221; announced Stubby.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221; exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Billy Junior, their father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just saw them! I was running along the road, coming home
from visiting the dogs over on the Samuelson farm when I heard
the most pitiful crying as a wagon passed me. Stopping to listen,
I recognized Judy&#8217;s voice saying, &#8216;I want to go home to my mama!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
You&#8217;re a naughty man to carry us off! If you don&#8217;t let us out
of this wagon, my grandpa will butt you when he catches
you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, he will!&#8217; cried Punch. &#8216;And my papa will help my
grandpa butt and hook you! Stop and let us jump out!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was while they were crying the wagon passed me, and I
barked, &#8216;Stop crying, Punch and Judy! I will bring your grandfather!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Uncle Stubby, do get us away from this naughty man!
He is a butcher and we are afraid he will kill us. Oh, oh, oh!
Do hurry and get us out of here before he makes us up into
chops!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trotted along behind the wagon and talked to them, telling
them to cease crying or they would make themselves sick, and that
I would go along with them and see what I could do.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we were passing the mill, who should come out but Button.
He followed too, and I explained the situation to him and
told him to stay with the Twins and find out where the butcher
took them; that as soon as he knew this, he was to hurry back
here and tell you; that if someone did not go along with them and
tell us where they had been taken, we never could find them in a
big city like Milwaukee. While he was doing that, I would return
to the farm for you and then we would all go and rescue the Twins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
from the butcher. Picking them up on the road the way he did
was nothing less than stealing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s not stop to talk another minute,&#8221; said the Twins&#8217;
father, as he kissed his wife good-by and told her not to cry,
assuring he would bring their darlings back with him when he
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Billy Junior, but it is a <i>butcher</i> who has them, and he
will probably try to kill them to-night so that in case anyone searches
for them it will be impossible to find them, while if they were
alive it would be comparatively easy to locate them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, isn&#8217;t it awful to think of those darling babies being
butchered? And they are all alone! I shall go crazy if they are
not brought back,&#8221; wailed Daisy to Nannie after Stubby, Billy and
Billy Junior had departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, my dear, just how you feel,&#8221; answered Nannie, &#8220;but
let us trust in God and wait. I feel sure Billy and their father
will reach the Twins in time to rescue them. Probably while the
butcher is eating his supper they will butt down the stable door
and save them. Let us hope so, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Daisy and Nannie were trying to cheer one another, the
two goats and Stubby were running like mad down the road towards
Milwaukee. The sun was setting when they saw a big cloud
of dust in the distance, and at last who should they discover to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
be making it but Button! He had followed the butcher home
and as soon as he had seen the Twins taken from the wagon and
put in an open pen in the stable yard, he started back to tell the
others where the Twins were. Button reported all this the moment
they met on the road and he turned to hasten back to Milwaukee
with them. When they arrived at the butcher&#8217;s home,
they were glad to see that his house was on the outskirts of the city
and quite detached from those of his neighbors. It was now
dark, but through the lighted window they could see the butcher
eating his supper.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-104.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Now is our time,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just butt down a rail in
this fence and make a place large enough for us to crawl through.
Then I will do the same thing with the pen where the Twins are
imprisoned. We will have them out of here and on the way home
in a jiffy. Billy Junior, you stand at the foot of the kitchen steps
and if the butcher starts to come outdoors, butt him hard enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
to make him senseless so as to give us ample time to get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a dog came bounding out of the barn, but he soon
wished he had stayed where he was for in a moment Stubby and
Button both were on him. His howl brought the butcher to the
kitchen door. Seeing two dogs (he supposed Button was a dog)
he grabbed a mop that stood beside the door and ran to the dog&#8217;s
rescue&mdash;but what was that which first struck him in the middle of
the back and then chased him into the barn, where he received a
butt that sent him up into the haymow?</p>

<p>The moment Billy Junior saw the butcher land in the hay, he
gave the dog Stubby and Button were fighting a butt that sent him
sky high, landing him on the roof of an outshed where he stood for a
while too dazed to know what happened to him. Then Billy Junior
hurried to help his father, but Billy Whiskers and the Twins had
disappeared, so he knew they were already on the road toward
home. Maybe you think those kids did not run fast when once
they found themselves free!</p>

<p>As for the man who had stolen them, he was so bruised, he never
even looked in the direction of the pen where he had put the kids.
All he thought of was to get some liniment for his back. His poor
dog stayed on the roof of the shed all night, much too frightened
to attempt to get down.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-106a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>When the Whiskers family was all together once again, Judy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
said, &#8220;And what do you think, mama, the old
naughty butcher said as he leaned over the pen and
looked at us before he went in for his supper? &#8216;You
are two pretty fine looking kids, and if I was not so
tired and it was not so dark, I would butcher you to-night
and sell your nice fat tender little chops in the morning. But
I guess I will wait until it is light to-morrow and then kill you before
anyone comes around looking for you. So ta-ta until then,
my tender young kids!&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Punch. &#8220;That is just what he said. He had the
meanest face you ever saw. When I grow up I am going to go to
Milwaukee and look for him, and butt him until he cries for mercy,
so I am!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-106b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I wish you children to promise me now that you will never
go out in the road alone again. Some member of your family must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
always be with you, for you see now how easily you can be kidnaped.
If Uncle Stubby had not just happened to be on the road,
you would never have been rescued,&#8221; said their mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;We promise! We promise! And cross our hearts we never
will go in the road alone!&#8221;</p>

<small>TROUBLE OVER GINGER COOKIES</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-109.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp;FEW days after all this excitement Billy went over to
Mr. Goodrich&#8217;s farm, which was near that of Mr.
Watson, to have a chat with the goats there. On his
way to the pasture where the goats were grazing, he
had to pass the kitchen door which happened to be open and through
which came the delicious odor of hot ginger cookies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yum, yum! How I do love ginger cookies,&#8221; thought Billy.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll just take a peek, and see if I cannot get one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cautiously creeping up the kitchen steps, he peeped in. Seeing
no one but spying a whole bread board covered with the cookies
which had just been taken from the pans to cool, he skipped across
the floor and rolled three or four into his mouth, when he heard
someone coming up out of the cellar and he made his escape in a
hurry. He had reached the bottom of the steps when he saw two
little boys coming from the barnyard carrying a basket of eggs between
them. He crept under the steps so they would not see him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Within a few feet of the house, one stopped short, grabbed the other
by the arm, exclaiming as he did so:</p>

<p>&#8220;Joe, I smell ginger cookies! Come, let&#8217;s hurry and get Augusta
to give us some. Oh, Augusta,&#8221; raising his voice, &#8220;do give us some
cookies! They smell too good for anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do, Gustie! I just <i>love</i> your cookies. They are so much
better than our cook makes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good-natured Augusta was about to give them half a dozen or
so when she noticed that some had already been taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t give you any more. You have already helped yourselves
to half a pan of them. Do you think I have nothing to
do but make cookies for you two
to eat like little pigs?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-110.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about,
Gusta? We just
this minute came
in the door. We
never touched
your cookies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly we
didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Joe,
backing up Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
add lying to your stealing! Guess I know! Those cookies go just
twelve in a pan, and four of them are gone. Do you mean to tell
me they put on their hats and went out for a walk? Shame on you,
boys, for lying to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I tell you, Gusta, we never touched them or as much as knew
they were here until we came in the door. You came in the same
moment we did. And here we are standing over on this side of the
room and the cookies are away over there on that side. Now tell
me how we could have gotten them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you may have been over here and grabbed them and run
back to the door when you heard me coming,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t, and you are a mean old thing to accuse us of lying
and stealing&mdash;two things we do not do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, merciful goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Augusta, throwing up her
hands and looking with horror at her clean kitchen floor. &#8220;See,
see! Some one has been in here and tracked mud all over my
floor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! See there, now! Whoever did that stole your cookies
too,&#8221; said Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet it was the grocery boy, as no one else comes around here,&#8221;
said Augusta.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gusta, you are too quick to accuse people when you really have
no reason to do so. These are not the footprints of a person at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
but of some animal, and the tracks look like those of a sheep or a
goat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they do! Well, just wait until I find the animal and I will
give it a good beating with my broom,&#8221; she threatened. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care so much for the cookies as I do about the floor, for now I shall
have to scrub it again, and there is no fun in getting down on my
rheumatic knees to clean this floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Augusta was grumbling, the boys edged their way over to
the table and helped themselves to three cookies apiece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Gusta, quick! I smell something burning,&#8221; cried Ned.
&#8220;It must be more cookies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Horrors! When she reached the oven door and opened it, a
cloud of black smoke rushed out and when she carried her pan of
cookies over to the table she saw at a glance they were burned to a
crisp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Ned, take them out and throw them in the swill pail,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>This the boy did, and presently Augusta, Ned and Joe had the
pleasure of seeing a big white goat dancing around like mad. Billy
had gone to the pail to eat the discarded cookies, and not knowing
they were so hot, had taken two, one of which stuck to the roof of
his mouth, burning him dreadfully and causing him to dance with
the pain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;There is your cookie thief, Gusta! You better go after him with
your broom,&#8221; said Ned.</p>



<p>Augusta grabbed the broom and rushed toward Billy, but Billy
was in no mood to be reproved in this manner, so when she was near
him he surprised her by butting her right over his head, and she
landed in the horse&#8217;s drinking trough with a great splash. The boys,
enjoying all this, began to throw the eggs from their basket at Billy.
Of course when they hit him they broke and the yellow yolks ran
all over his nice white coat. This angered him and he ran toward
the house to butt the boys, but they leaped inside the door and shut
it, throwing more eggs at him from the safety of the window.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-114.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Just now Mrs. Goodrich entered the kitchen and seeing the boys
throwing eggs from the basket, exclaimed, &#8220;Boys, boys! What are
you doing? What do you mean by throwing nice fresh eggs at
something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, we forgot they were <i>eggs</i>! We were throwing them at a
big, cross white goat outside. He has just butted Gusta into the
watering trough, and we were trying to chase him away. Here he
comes up the steps now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bing, bing, bangety-bing! Two hard butts in quick succession on
the kitchen door. As it was not tightly closed, it flew open and in
came Billy, looking for his tormentors. One dove under the table,
the other stepped up on the table right on top of the cookies, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Mrs. Goodrich plunged into the dining room and barricaded the
door by pushing the dining table against it and
piling the chairs on top of it.</p>

<p>Billy tried to get at the boy under the table
but could not do so as the table stood against
the wall. But he could reach the boy on
top of the table by climbing on a chair beside
it. This he did but as he came up
one side, the boy jumped down the
other, upset the table and the beloved
cookies rolled in all directions.
Seeing this, Billy
let the boys escape and
turned his attention to eating
every cookie he could
find. He had just concluded
he had found them all, even to
the one he pawed out from under
the stove when who should
appear in the doorway
but the hired man,
pitchfork in hand. He was evidently in pursuit of Billy Whiskers.</p>



<p>Now there was one thing Billy feared and that was a pitchfork.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
He had good reason to do so, for he had been chased with them and
had had them stuck in his sides many, many times. Consequently
on seeing this man standing in the doorway armed with one, he
looked around for a way to get out of the room. There was the
door into the dining room so well barricaded by Mrs. Goodrich and
the outside door guarded by the man with the pitchfork. Oh, <i>there</i>
was a flight of stairs and without a moment&#8217;s hesitation he ran up
them, the man close behind, trying his best to reach him with the
long-handled fork. Arriving at the top, he saw another flight leading
down into the front hall. Down these he plunged, but half way
down he encountered Mrs. Goodrich. She was so frightened at
seeing the big goat coming toward her that she lost her balance and
went rolling to the bottom. Billy ran into the living-room and
thank goodness, a window was open. He jumped through and made
his escape down the road. By the time the hired man had picked up
Mrs. Goodrich and had satisfied himself no bones were broken, Billy
was out of sight and there was no telling in which direction he had
gone. So he went around to the kitchen to see how Augusta was
getting along. He found her all right physically but mentally she
was mad as a wet cat. For had not Olie, her best beau, seen her in a
very undignified position, sitting in the watering trough with legs
hanging over and struggling to get out? And worse yet, he had
laughed when he tried to help her out. He could not control himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
for she looked too funny stuck fast in the trough. And so now
all she would say was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Olie Oleson, I will never, no, <i>never</i> speak another word to you as
long as I live! So <i>there</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Olie had heard this threat many times before so that it did not
bother him in the least, for he knew the very next time she saw him
she would have forgotten all about her threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I won&#8217;t go back and see the goats this morning but wait
until these people cool off,&#8221; thought Billy. &#8220;If that hired man
should happen to see me down in the pasture, he might take a shot
at me. My, but those ginger cookies were good! Wish I could
have taken some to Nannie and the rest of the family at home. The
Twins especially would have been delighted with them. I don&#8217;t
see why goats and animals don&#8217;t have pockets in the sides of their
skins. It would be such a convenience for them to be able to
take presents home to their families and to carry a lunch sometimes
when they have no idea when they will be able to find food the next
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so musing, Billy went home.</p>

<small>THE CHUMS HAVE A DAY OFF</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-117.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HO, Stubby and Button, come over here a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Button. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there as soon
as I finish eating this fish head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world can you enjoy those nasty, smelly
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they are delicious! Don&#8217;t you know the old saying, &#8216;The
nearer the bone, the sweeter the meat&#8217;? Well, as these fish heads
are all bone, that makes what little meat there is on them mighty
sweet and toothsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are a regular epicure, you are!&#8221; exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want of us?&#8221; asked Stubby, coming up to Billy
Whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this: what do you say to our going into town and spending
a day? It is so quiet out here where nothing ever happens that I
feel I shall explode unless I hear a little noise and see something
going on with a little life in it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;Just the thing! Life out here is beginning to grow a little monotonous
for me also after our exciting life of moving from one place to
another almost every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Button, leave your smelly old fish head and come here!
Billy has a dandy plan for us all,&#8221; called Stubby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming!&#8221; called the black cat. &#8220;I have just finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need for you to come here. We will pass you on the way we
are going to take,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are going some place, are you? I was just thinking this
morning that it was about time you were suggesting a trip somewhere,
as you have remained here quite a while for you. And every
so often the wanderlust strikes you and off you go. The only thing
that would keep you here longer would be that you have been everywhere
but to the North Pole and the South Pole. Each day I have
been expecting you to propose a trip to the moon in an airship of
some kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not weary of the farm yet, but I feel I should like a
little excitement just for a day to give a little spice to life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is the plan you have in mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much, only for us three to go into town and spend the
day and return at nightfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As wild as that, is it? Very well, I am with you for that trip.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
But no more long trips, gallivanting all over the face of the globe
for me for a year at least. I am tired seeing strange countries and
foreign peoples for a while. I want to stay home and enjoy its quiet
and comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, you must be feeling old, Button, to speak like that. You,
the friskiest cat in the world, talking of settling down!&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later the three Chums were trotting down the alley
back of the main street in town. They were about to pass a movie
theater when, hearing the music and seeing the rear doors open for
ventilation, they thought they would go in and have a peep at the
film being run off.</p>

<p>Button being black as ink ran down the middle aisle without being
seen, but just then three or four people stepped into the aisle to go
out and Button dodged under a lady&#8217;s seat. She did not see the cat
but felt something soft rub across her legs. Immediately she
thought it was a big rat and gave one blood-curdling scream that
upset the entire audience for they did not know what had happened,
and all rushed frantically from the theater. All because one unseen
cat had rubbed against a woman!</p>

<p>The proprietor rushed out on the stage in front of the curtain to
discover the cause of the panic but all he saw were empty seats and
the crowd pushing and hurrying pell-mell out the doors. As he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
stood there trying to fathom the trouble, he saw in the darkness
among the empty seats two bright yellow lights flash from aisle to
aisle under the seats and then over them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott! What can that be? Whatever it is, it must be
what frightened the people away. Ikey, come here quick, and tell
me what it is I see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you crazy? Can&#8217;t you tell what you see with your own
eyes?&#8221; the boy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look over in that dark corner, and tell me if you see two yellow
balls of fire jumping here and there and everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. And I see nothing but just those two spots. What is
more, I am going to get out, for now they are coming straight this
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both man and boy hurried behind the screen and were beginning
to tell the people working about the theater what they had seen when
cool as you please out walked Button from behind the screen and
stood gazing at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy Moses, those lights we saw were only the yellow eyes of
this cat! But look, Ikey, he is black all over. A black cat has
walked across our stage. That means bad luck for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t, you superstitious old man! Black cats or white
cats can&#8217;t bring or take good luck or bad. In this age we don&#8217;t
believe in such things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;Anyhow get him out of here! Get him out of here! For he has
driven all our audience away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you care, Solomon? They have paid their money.
What does it matter whether or not they see the picture? Their
money is all you want. But I&#8217;ll drive him out for you anyway,&#8221; and
a book was hurled at Button&#8217;s head by a man standing by an open
window a few feet away from the
cat.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-121.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Button dodged the book,
then with a long leap
went flying over
the man&#8217;s head
and through the
open window out
into the alley, where
by chance he happened to alight on the back of a passing dog.
Feeling Button&#8217;s claws dig into him, he set up a howl and ran down
the alley lickety-split. He passed Billy and Stubby, who stood
aside and laughed so heartily at the sight of Button clinging to the
dog&#8217;s back that they nearly fell over in their merriment. But even
as they looked, the dog ducked down and crawled under a fence,
scraping Button off. Billy and Stubby ran down the alley where
Button stood, too dazed and bruised to move for he had received a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
hard bump on his head when the dog crawled under the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake, how did you happen to be playing circus with
that dog?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could only have seen yourself, you would have died with
laughter. You looked so comical all hunched up riding on that
dog&#8217;s back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so would you have been hunched up if you had been trying
to stick on, not by the skin of your teeth but by your claws which
kept slipping. I knew if I let go I should have a terrible tumble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here come the people out of the back of that theater, looking for
you. We better be going,&#8221; said Billy. And so the three trotted
down the alley until they came to a cross street. They had gone
but a little way down this street when they came to a grocery store.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall leave you fellows here and go on and see if I cannot
find something to eat to my liking,&#8221; said Stubby. &#8220;Where shall
we meet when it is time to go home, and at what time shall we meet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the crossroads at the edge of town, around six o&#8217;clock,&#8221; replied
Billy. &#8220;What are you two going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Just walk along and see what turns up,&#8221;
said Stubby.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Button?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tag along with you, Billy, until I think of something I should
like to do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;So long then, until we meet again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubby ran through the side door of the grocery and found himself
in a kind of store room and shipping room combined, as there
were shelves full of canned goods, boxes of crackers and breakfast
foods, while on the floor were baskets of groceries ready to be delivered.
All around the room next to the wall were ranged barrels
of molasses, kerosene, vinegar and such things.</p>

<p>Just as Stubby entered, a boy came in to get a box of crackers
from a high shelf and as he reached for it his foot slipped and in
trying to save himself from falling, the box dropped out of his hands
and went crashing to the floor, knocking off the lid and all the
crackers spilling over the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see what I have done,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Spilled all those
crackers, and spoiled them too, for after being on the dirty floor they
will have to be thrown away.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment he was called to the front of the store and the moment
he left, Stubby came from behind the barrel where he had
been hiding and ate the crackers. He ate every one and even licked
up the crumbs, they were such good, fresh, crisp crackers. When
the boy came back and saw they had disappeared he took it for
granted that someone had swept them up. This time he had come
for some molasses and while it was running into the quart measure,
he took a handful of crackers and stuck them one by one under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
molasses spigot, letting the molasses trickle all over them, and then
putting the whole cracker in his mouth at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, but they do taste good! Almost as good as molasses candy!&#8221;
he was saying when someone called him and he seized the quart
measure and hurried away, forgetting to turn off the spigot.</p>

<p>Stubby had been watching all this and now ran over to the molasses
barrel and let some of the sweet stuff drop into his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, oh my, that is almost as good as candy, just as the boy said!
If I only had a cracker or two, I would be fixed. Why, there is the
box now! I&#8217;ll just go over and get a mouthful of crackers and bring
them back and hold them under the spigot until they are covered
with molasses, the way the boy did, and eat them whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time the molasses was running out on the floor, making a
big puddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yum, yum! These crackers and molasses taste good! I just
love molasses candy, and this is next thing to it. I must have another
mouthful before someone comes and cleans up this mess,&#8221; but he
had not the time for just then the owner of the grocery entered the
side door and seeing a stray dog in his store raised his leg to kick him
out. But alas, as he lifted his foot, the other slipped in the molasses
and he sat down squarely in it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who left that spigot turned on?&#8221; he roared.</p>

<p>Stubby waited to hear no more for he knew the poor boy would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
be punished. Not wishing to pass the man, and there being no other
way out, Stubby decided to jump up on a high box and from it take
a flying leap over the man&#8217;s head out into the alley. This he did
and landed safely. In a minute more there was no sight of a little
stubby-tailed dog in that alley.</p>

<p>While Stubby was in the grocery store, Billy had wandered on a
block or two when he heard a great hullabaloo in a back yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what is going on there. I&#8217;ll just run along and peek
in,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>Arrived at the yard where he heard all the whistling and laughter,
he peeked through the half open gate and this is what he saw: four
boys trying to hitch a big dog to a little express wagon. And they
were having a most difficult time doing it for the dog would not
stand up but insisted on crouching on the ground. Two boys tried
to hold him up while the other two adjusted the harness. But no
use; he would not stand up. At last the boys grew provoked and the
boy on either side of him gave the dog a cruel blow with a whip and
pushed him forward. In his surprise, the dog bounded forward.
Once he was started the boys had no way of controlling him for the
reins were dangling over his back. His starting had surprised the
boys as much as their whipping had surprised the dog. Down the
long back yard he went, dragging the little express wagon straight
toward the gate through which Billy was peeping. When he dashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
through it, the wheels on one side of the wagon collided with the
gate post. This broke the traces, releasing the dog. Down the
street he went like mad to escape his tormentors.</p>

<p>On reaching the gate the boys spied Billy. One lad, who had
once owned a pair of goats and a little wagon, called out, &#8220;Come
ahead, fellows! Let&#8217;s hitch up the goat! He is a big, fine creature
and can pull the wagon easier than the dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost before Billy knew what was happening, he found himself
hitched to the little express wagon and being driven down the street.
At first he enjoyed it, until too many boys got in the wagon at one
time. This treatment made Billy angry and he decided to upset
them the first opportunity he had. When he came to a place where
the sidewalk was high from the street pavement, he ran off the walk,
turning the little wagon completely upside down and spilling out all
the boys. As Billy ran off, one boy caught hold of the reins that
were dragging on the ground, jumped in the wagon which had
righted itself by this time, and on down the street they went. When
they came to a small bridge that spanned a wide ditch, Billy said to
himself, &#8220;Here is where I lose the last boy!&#8221; and with extra exertion
he ran faster than he had ever run in all his life. As he reached the
bridge, instead of going over it he swerved and plunged down the
bank right into the little stream which was narrow but deep. Here
he spilled the boy out and while he was picking himself up, Billy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
climbed up the opposite bank and headed for the crossroads where
he had agreed to meet Stubby and Button.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-127.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He reached this rendezvous about ten minutes before the others.
When they came and saw him standing in the traces half asleep, they
wanted to know where and how he had acquired the wagon. He
told them and added that he was going to take it home with him, and
the boys could find it as best they could.</p>

<p>When the Chums reached the farm, Mr. Watson was sitting on
his front porch reading, but he glanced up at the sound of wheels
turning into his driveway and he had to laugh for there was Billy
pulling a very new looking little express wagon, with Stubby and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Button sitting on the front seat. Indeed they had the appearance
of driving the little turnout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well! I wonder how Billy came by that wagon.
Probably some little boy has hitched him to it and then hit him with
a whip or done something to him he did not like and he has run
off with the wagon. I expect in a short time someone will appear
looking for it. In the meantime I will unhitch Billy and take care
of the wagon.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not until the next morning that anyone came for it, as
it took the boys all that time to discover where Billy had gone.</p>

<small>BUTTING MATCHES</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-129.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SHEP, the Watson dog, noticed that all the animals
seemed greatly excited. They wandered around the
farmyard, lay down for a few minutes and then got up
to begin their restless wandering again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something is up, and I bet it is some devilment of Billy Whiskers.
I&#8217;ll just keep my eye on the villain without his knowing it and discover
what it is that is going on,&#8221; thought Shep.</p>

<p>Now the night pasture where the cows were allowed to wander
after they had been milked in the evening was directly the other
side of the barn. The gate between was left standing open so the
cattle could pass from barnyard to pasture and back again at their
pleasure. This pasture led down a steep hill to the stream and a
nice grassy meadow, and as the banks of the stream were sandy, the
cattle liked to go there to roll in the sand and dry their coats after a
bath in the pools of the stream.</p>

<p>It was bright moonlight&mdash;one of those nights when the moon rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
early. For which Shep was thankful, as it made it easy to watch
the cattle. Just as he surmised, the minute the moon appeared over
the top of the high hill in front of the house and shed its light over
the barnyard and pasture, Billy Whiskers, Billy Junior, Nannie and
Daisy slipped off the watch tower, as they called the high straw
stack on which they slept, and from which vantage point they could
see all that went on. They made straight for the pasture. Shep
kept an eye on Billy, saw him lead his family through the gate
into the pasture, and was a little amazed to find all the cattle followed
them in groups of two and three.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what in the world are they up to? I&#8217;ll go up on the straw
stack they just left and see where they go. Not one of them is stopping
to take so much as a mouthful of clover, and that is really fine
clover in their field, and generally they love to munch it when the
dew is on it as now. So there must be something very exciting ahead
of them. Now they are going down the hill toward the stream.
What is that line of black I see coming from the Smith farm? I
declare it is his cattle, even to the big hogs! There comes another
line of cattle from the direction of the Jones farm. It must be a big
party they are having.&#8221;</p>

<p>When all the animals arrived at the edge of the stream where
stretched the wide beach of sand, Shep could see they were forming
a great circle.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-131.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;What is up, I wonder?&#8221; he said over and over to himself. But
he did not have to wait long to know, for Billy stepped into the center
of the ring and then out stepped Satan, one of the neighbor&#8217;s big,
coal-black goats, and joined him. After sniffing each other&#8217;s noses,
they backed off a few paces and then rushed toward one another
with great force. There was a clash of horns, followed with a twisting
of necks and much side-stepping until Billy had Satan down on
his knees. After this they separated, each seeking his own particular
group of animal friends. In less time than it takes to tell, they were
back in the middle of the ring fighting again. But they did not seem
to be fighting to hurt one another, but rather to see which could butt
the harder and down the other. They would advance slowly step
by step, eyes unwinkingly on the adversary until within a few feet of
touching noses. Then without a sound one or the other would
spring forward and they would butt their foreheads together or lock
horns. The way they would twist their necks one would certainly
think they would break them. At other times they would stand on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
their hind legs and push one another forward and backward, striking
out with their fore legs.</p>

<p>All this time the onlookers pawed the ground in excitement and
bellowed their pleasure or disgruntlement as their favorite was
winning or losing.</p>

<p>Billy won the first round, and all the animals clustered around the
contestants, complimenting them on their prowess and skill.</p>

<p>After Billy Whiskers and Satan had taken a drink and waded
in the stream to cool off, they lay down to watch the next feature on
the program. This was a test of strength between two blooded bulls,
one a red Hereford, the other a red and white Durham. The
Hereford was ever on the alert but much lighter in weight than the
Durham, who was of powerful build. But even though he could
hit the most powerful blow, the alert Hereford was likely to fly
around and give him a couple punches in the ribs while he was
slowly getting in position to hook him. It had been agreed they
were not to run their horns into one another, as this was purely a
friendly bout, just to exhibit their skill, and indeed it did prove to
be a most exciting display of strength and quickness. They whirled
and turned, locked horns and twisted each other&#8217;s necks until one
could almost hear the bones crack. Whenever they locked horns
and it came to a display of strength, the Durham was away ahead,
and he would push the Hereford into the stream, but when it came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
to hooking, as they would have done in a real fight, the Hereford was
superior, for his long, sharp horns would have made short work of
the big, clumsy Durham.</p>

<p>Next in order was a fight between two fat rams with double twisted
horns, who fought standing facing each other, their big twisted horns
locked together. They forced each other forward and backward
across the ring, kicking up the dirt at a great rate. When time was
called, it was found they could not unlock their horns. In fact, in
the morning when Mr. Watson found them that way it took both
him and his hired man quite a while to separate them.</p>

<p>This fight ended the evening&#8217;s performance, which all had enjoyed
so much that they planned then and there to have a second one a
week from that night, which was to be for just the younger animals&mdash;the
calves, colts, lambs and kids. Of course the Twins were the
first to ask to be in it, and their parents saying they could, Billy
Whiskers promised to give them some lessons to prepare them for
the event.</p>

<p>Just before they separated, someone proposed they have an exhibition
of jumping and running as well. This was considered a
good proposal and was accepted unanimously, though everyone said
they knew just who would win those races: Sal Scrugs. She was
known to be the highest jumper and fleetest runner of all the animals
far and near.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;No, there is Shep,&#8221; argued someone. &#8220;We must ask him to
compete with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some declared he would say no, while others were sure he would
enjoy it. So it was left to Billy to approach him on the subject, and
with many complimentary expressions for those who had participated,
the animals separated, promising to be on hand at the next
meeting.</p>

<small>THE DUCKS GROW DIZZY-HEADED</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-135.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE day after the butting match a laughable thing happened
at the farm.</p>

<p>A big tub of cider was down in the orchard waiting
for the kegs to put it in when some ducks on their way
for a swim in the pond smelt something like rotten apples, a
food all ducks like very much. They decided to stop and eat
some. Consequently they flew up on the edge of the tub, and
seeing it filled almost to overflowing, they thought it would be nice
to go swimming in anything that smelt so good. Three old mother
ducks and five young ones jumped in that cider. They tasted it and
it was so refreshing a draught that they kept drinking as they swam
about. The more they tasted it, the more they wanted. But presently
they could not tell when they were drinking it and when they
were not, as they felt queer in the head. Everything seemed to be
running around like mad; even the wheelbarrows were going around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
in circles with no person pushing them, while the big barn was swaying
as in a gale.</p>

<p>At last one old duck quacked to another, &#8220;Sister, just see how
crazily everything in the barnyard is acting. Even the barn itself
looks as if it would topple over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly does! I was noticing it when you spoke,&#8221; said a
second.</p>

<p>&#8220;We better go over and see what causes it,&#8221; suggested the third
old duck.</p>

<p>The young ducks, on being asked, preferred to stay where they
were and swim around.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, what is the matter with this tub? It doesn&#8217;t stand still, and
I cannot get out. It is acting just the same as everything over in
the barnyard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be we are having some kind of a storm. Perhaps it is a
radio storm. Not that I ever heard of a radio storm, but I will
wager there <i>are</i> such things. There are so many new things these
days, one can&#8217;t say there can&#8217;t be such a thing, for if they do, there it
is the next day right before them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare,&#8221; exclaimed one old duck as she fell over on her
side, &#8220;this tub rocks so it made me tumble over, and to save my life
I can&#8217;t get back on the right rim of this tub. There are two rims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
and every time I step on one it is not there. What can be the matter?
My head feels so dizzy. Does yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it did! And my ears ring something dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is again! To save my life I can&#8217;t sit up straight with
this tub running around in circles as it does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We better make an extra effort to get out of this tub, for it might
be possible that this yellow fluid has affected us.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-137.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Now you have found the
trouble! The stuff we have been
drinking is the cause of our
dizziness, I am sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Shep and the
hired man came along
the path. Seeing the
ducks in the tub, Shep
tried to frighten them, but they only quacked and then left their bills
stretched open, too crazy-headed to shut them. The more Shep
barked at them, the more they quacked and flapped their wings, but
they could not get out of the tub. When the hired man reached
them, he nearly died laughing at the queer actions of the ducks.
He picked them up one after the other and set them on the ground,
but then they only made him laugh the more for they stepped so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
high and waddled along with such a rolling gait, their heads held
to one side in such a peculiar manner, he doubled up with mirth.</p>

<p>But this was not all of it. He turned over the tub of cider&mdash;there
was nothing else to do after the ducks had been in it. But little did
he think what a commotion it was going to create among the fowls.
When the geese came along on their way to the pond and smelled the
cider and saw it running on the ground in little rivulets, they craned
their long necks to get a better smell. This second whiff only assured
them the liquid was surely made of apples. They began to
drink all they could catch in their bills as it ran along the hard-beaten
path. Soon they too were lifting their feet so high that their
big bodies toppled over and at last they just rolled on the grass, their
legs sticking straight up in the air, where they lay hissing until the
hired man came and carried them off to the goose house. Before
night even the turkeys and chickens had had some of the troublesome
cider. In consequence the old turkey gobbler nearly gobbled his
head off as he puffed himself out and went strutting uncertainly
about the yard. As for the roosters, they crowed and crowed and
crowed until they fell off the fence from sheer exhaustion. Really
it was as comical a sight as anyone could well imagine to see the
fowls reeling and staggering around the barnyard in such a ridiculous
manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson had several orders for geese, ducks and chickens to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
be filled the next morning. He generally had a difficult time catching
just the ones he wished to sell, but for a wonder to-night he could
walk right up to any fowl and pick it up without it so much as lifting
a wing in flight or making a single outcry. You see the cider had
made them so stupid they were nearly sound asleep.</p>

<small>THE NEW ELECTRIC WASHER</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-141.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ANY one who has ever lived in the country and kept turkeys
and peacocks knows the moment a stranger drives
by, those fowls give the alarm as surely as a good watchdog
barks, only they set up a terrible clatter, the peacock
by jumping on something high and screeching out his discordant
call that carries a long way, it is so penetrating, and old Mr.
Turkey Gobbler spreading his tail and wings so wide they drag on
the ground as he puffs himself out with pride until he looks as if he
would surely burst.</p>

<p>Consequently when Hiram, the hired man on the Watson farm,
heard the racket in the barnyard, he walked to the door to see who
was coming. There turning in the drive was a delivery wagon
bringing the new electric washing machine Mr. Watson had bought.
Hiram put down his pitchfork and went to help the men unload it
and set it up. Of course, Billy Whiskers, that old Curiosity Shop,
had to go too, for it would never do to have anything new come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
the farm and Billy not know about it.
Neither would it do to have Billy do or
see anything Stubby and Button missed.
And of course when the Twins saw their
grandfather and their Uncle Stubby and
Uncle Button going any place, they had
to go along. So when Hiram thought
he heard footsteps behind him and turned
his head to look, what should he see but
quite a procession tagging behind him.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-142.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare to goodness if that old Billy isn&#8217;t the
most curious animal I ever ran across! He tags me
from morning until night, so I almost feel I had a tail
tied to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Hiram!&#8221; called Mr. Watson, &#8220;come and
help us put up the washing machine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming! Coming!&#8221; answered Hiram.</p>

<p>After an hour of pulling, hauling and lifting,
with everyone bossing everyone else and stepping
on one another&#8217;s fingers and toes, to say nothing of
Billy Whiskers adding to the confusion by being
under their feet, the necessary electric wiring was
completed and the washing machine was in place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Button had climbed on top of a cupboard in the laundry, thinking
this would be a fine place from which to see all that went on and
still escape being kicked or put out. Stubby had run under the table
and jumped into a clothes basket where he would be out of the way
and still could watch every move made. As for Billy, he was here,
there and everywhere, under everyone&#8217;s feet and running across
their paths and getting in the way generally, being put out of the
laundry one minute and returning the next when they were busy over
the machine.</p>

<p>At last it was set up and ready to start, and the man who had
brought it from town walked over to the wall and touched a black
button. The water began to churn round and round a piece of
clothing the man had put in the washer to show them how quickly it
would be washed clean.</p>

<p>Billy was so interested that he walked straight up to it and stuck
his nose against the glass case, for what puzzled him most was how
the water got in the tub when he had seen no one pour it in, and he
knew the water nearest at hand was away down in the pond at the
foot of the hill.</p>

<p>As for Button, he stretched his neck so far over the top of the cupboard
that he nearly toppled off, and Stubby barked in his surprise
and kept jumping in and out of the basket. In fact, he was so
nervous he did not know what he was doing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Swish! Swish! Swish! went the water, becoming all foamy
and white.</p>

<p>As Button gazed, the machine stopped and the water grew still.
Then all of a sudden it began to swish around again, though no
person was near it. The person nearest the machine was a man
standing by the wall, his finger on a little black button in the wall,
while next him stood Hilda, clapping her hands
in delight. You see, she did the
washing.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-144.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Now it will be only
child&#8217;s play to do the
washing, even though we
do have big tablecloths and
sheets,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They were all leaving the laundry and Billy was
about to go too, when he found himself all tangled
up with the tube that let the water into the tub and the electric wires
that furnished the power to run the machine. The first thing he
knew he felt prickles running all over him, and then a queer, jerky
feeling as if someone were pulling all the muscles in his body the
wrong way,&mdash;and that is the last he knew for a long time. Billy
had suffered a shock that knocked him over and made him unconscious!</p>




<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>When Mr. Watson turned to see why Billy did not come, and discovered
him stretched on the floor as if dead, he knew not what to
think until he saw the detached wires. Then he knew Billy had
suffered a shock of electricity. The men jumped off the wagon and
with the help they gave, Mr. Watson and Hiram soon had Billy all
right once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Watson, you need not worry. He is not killed for the current
in these machines is not strong enough to hurt anyone, much
less kill them,&#8221; said one of the men.</p>

<p>That very evening when Billy, his family, Stubby and Button and
a few friends were resting by the straw stack, they wished to hear
from Billy&#8217;s own lips how a shock of electricity felt. He told
them: &#8220;You haven&#8217;t any idea what a peculiar sensation it is. At
first I felt all prickly, as if someone was sticking me full of needles
and pins. Then all my muscles began to double up, and that is the
last I knew about until I found myself on the grass outside the laundry
with Mr. Watson and the men working over me. Not a pleasant
sensation at all. I hope, I assure you, that Hilda never has one. It
would almost kill her if she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just before luncheon that day Stubby and Button had had a very
exciting experience. They had been coming home from Mr.
Jones&#8217; farm when they heard a child crying. They looked everywhere,
but still they could not see any child, and when they tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to follow the sound, it first led them in one direction and then in
another.</p>




<p>Presently Stubby said, &#8220;It seems to me the cry comes from the
stone quarry. Let&#8217;s go and look.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two ran up the steep side of the quarry and looked down
into the deep pit half-filled with water. At first they saw nothing.
Then they thought they distinguished something white floating
on the water close to the opposite side of the pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Button! You have sharper eyes than I. What do you
make out that white thing to be over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens! It is a child&#8217;s face. Did you ever see anything so
white in all your life?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the child saw Stubby and Button, and began to
cry anew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear, Button? From the sound of that cry the child
is almost exhausted from calling for help and from fright at being
in the water.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-144a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">MR. WATSON&#8217;S HIRED MAN SOON HAD A ROPE AROUND BILLY&#8217;S NECK.<br />

<span class="illoindent">(<span class="smcap">Page <a href="#Page_168">168</a></span>)</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it would be. What are we to do to get it out?
It is a little boy. I know by his coat, for he raised his arms to
signal to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes a farmer. Let us run down and bark just as he is
opposite the quarry. I&#8217;ll bark and you meow and we will run in
front of his horse and make such a fuss he will know there must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
something the matter in the quarry pit and perhaps he will stop
and go to see. Let&#8217;s hope so, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minute they disappeared, the child began to cry more pitifully
than ever, for of course he thought they had run away and
left him to his fate.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the old rattling wagon, the driver
whistling as hard as ever he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Stubby, &#8220;his wagon is making such a rumble he
would never have heard the child crying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is almost here. Now let us start,&#8221; said Button.</p>

<p>Down the steep side of the quarry they plunged pell-mell, and
jumped out before the horses so suddenly they leaped to one side
of the road and stopped short. It was done so quickly it nearly
threw the man off the seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Stub and Button, what did you do that fool thing for?&#8221;</p>

<p>You see the man knew the two very well, for he was Mr. Watson&#8217;s
hired man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You nearly scared the life out of the horses and came near upsetting
me in the bargain. Well, well, will you look at those fool
animals chasing each other up the steep side of the quarry? Here
they come down again! And they stand and look at me as if they
were trying to tell me something. Heigho, if they aren&#8217;t going up
again and looking down into the pit and barking and meowing like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
mad. Hark! Did I hear a child
cry?&#8221; He put his hand to his ear
and turned his head in that direction.
Sure enough, the cry was repeated.
&#8220;Jehoshaphat, I bet a child has
fallen into the quarry and that is
what those smart animals are trying to let me know about.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-148a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>With one bound he was out of the wagon and climbing up
the side of the quarry as fast as he could go, loose stones and dirt
flying in a shower behind him as he was in such a hurry to reach the
top. The second he got there, he discovered the pale face of the
child as it showed so plainly against the wet, black stones. He ran
around the pit until he was directly over where the child lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Hiram, come quick! Come quick! I can&#8217;t hang on
much longer. My fingers are getting numb!&#8221;</p>

<p>You see the man was no other than the little child&#8217;s own Uncle.
Down the steep side of the quarry he
started, but found he must go
further along the top and then
down, as the stones were soft and
broke under his feet and he feared
they might injure the child as they
rolled.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-148b.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>When the little fellow saw the man start to go down to him
again he cried out in fright and dismay: &#8220;Oh, Uncle Hiram,
don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t go away and leave me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Eddie. Indeed I won&#8217;t leave you. I am just
going over here a little way to find a better and safer place to
climb down.&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact, he was soon down and walking along a rocky ledge that
led straight to where the little fellow lay, and in a jiffy he had him
in his arms and was climbing the steep ascent, the child clasped
in a close embrace. When they were safely on the wagon, he asked
the boy how he happened to fall in the pit and he said he was coming
home from doing an errand and was walking near the edge
of the quarry when he saw a beautiful blue flower on the very edge
and while trying to get it the bank gave way and fell into the water
in the quarry pit, carrying him down with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long had you been there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ever and ever so long, Uncle! Seemed most like a year!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager it does seem like a year and more to you, and I never
would have found you if it had not been for Stubby and Button.
The old wagon was making such a racket and I was whistling so
loudly I never would have heard you cry above all that noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking down the road he saw a woman who seemed much excited
running in their direction and when they drew near enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
to distinguish who it was, they found it was Eddie&#8217;s mother, looking
for him. He had not come back from the errand on which
she had sent him, telling him to hurry home. As he was an obedient
son, she feared some ill had befallen him and was searching for
him. How she cried for joy when she had him in her arms and
knew he was safe! She declared she wanted to see Stubby and
Button and pet them and give them the biggest chicken dinner
they had ever had to show her appreciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are such smart animals, I know they will understand everything
you say to them, and enjoy and thank you for the dinner,&#8221;
said Mr. Watson&#8217;s hired man. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring them over with me to-morrow
when I pass your house on my way to the mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus another good deed was added to the long list of those done
by Stubby and Button as the years went by.</p>

<small>CATCHING THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-151.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was the night before Thanksgiving rather than Christmas,
and in the house all was quiet as a mouse. But
not so in the barnyard. Everything there was confusion
and hubbub for the biggest, fattest turkey gobbler of
the flock was to be captured and killed for the Thanksgiving feast.
He had lived to see all his flock slain with the exception of a young
gobbler and three or four turkey hens. Consequently when he saw
a boy and a man come into the barnyard and walk toward him,
holding out hands filled with corn and wheat, he had his suspicions.
He had seen sixty or seventy members of his flock go up to men
to eat from their hands only to be grabbed by the neck and carried
off, never to be seen again. It was because of this that when anyone
offered him anything to eat, no matter what it was, he drew
in his feathers, stuck out his neck and ran for dear life and hid
until they had left the barnyard.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk now and he had just fallen into a doze as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
he rested in his usual roosting place on the lower limb of an old
oak tree behind the woodpile. Suddenly he was rudely awakened
by someone catching hold of one of his legs. He roused with a
start to find it was a big boy trying to capture him. With a spasm
of fear he flapped his wings and tried to fly to a higher limb, but
he was unable to do that for the boy grasped one of his legs firmly
and pulled him back.</p>

<p>Just then the gobbler spied Billy Whiskers standing by the woodpile
and he gobbled for him to aid him. &#8220;Save me! Save me,
Billy!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a flash Billy ran up the woodpile on which the boy was standing.
This started the wood to rolling, and the boy was forced to
release the turkey&#8217;s leg or have his own broken in a fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy, why <i>can&#8217;t</i> you mind your own business and not stick
your nose into what doesn&#8217;t concern you?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The moment the old gobbler was released, he tried to decide
which would be the safer place for him; higher up in the tree or a
new hiding place altogether. But where would that be? If he
flew into another tree, they would see him. If he chose the barn,
they would follow him. Likewise if he ran behind any of the
straw stacks, they would follow there.</p>

<p>Oh where, oh where should he go? While the boy was getting
off the woodpile was his only chance for the man would soon return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
from chasing the young gobbler and turkey hens. At last he
decided to run into the barn as there were numerous dark corners
there where he could hide. Once his mind was made up, it did
not take long for him to fly out of the tree and, half flying, half
running, he made his way to the barn. He went to the back door
as that was out of sight of the man who was chasing the other turkeys
round and round the barn, over barrels and under fences and
about pigsties, with Billy Whiskers getting in his way just when
he reached out to take hold of a fowl and it would escape. The
man called Billy every name he could think of, and threw stones
at him too, but what cared he when he was doing his friends, the
turkeys, a good turn? He could not stand by and hear the pitiful
call of the turkeys and not try to do something to save them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-153.jpg" alt="" /></div>




<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Once the man succeeded in catching a young gobbler, and had
him under his arm carrying him away to have his head chopped
off, when the turkey called, &#8220;Billy, save me quickly or it will be
too late! He is carrying me to the block to chop off my head!
I have seen all my brothers and sisters go this terrible way. Oh,
quick, Billy, quick! Do something or it will be too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy baaed back to the poor panic-stricken young turkey, &#8220;I will!
I will save you!&#8221; and all the other fowls in the barnyard and even
the pigs in the pens and the cows standing around chewing their
cuds called out, &#8220;Oh, hurry, Billy, hurry or you will be too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was almost to the fatal block but Billy was creeping
up still closer and closer to him until he was only six feet away.
Then with a little bound Billy gave the man a butt that sent man,
turkey and all away over the block, the fellow falling on his face
and releasing the turkey as he fell. The moment that turkey
found itself free it ran toward the barn and quickly disappeared
in the darkness within.</p>

<p>The man was so intensely angry at Billy that he picked up a
club and started in pursuit of him. But he might just as well have
attempted to catch a whirlwind as Billy when he was on the run.
However, he chased him away out into the pasture until Billy took
the path to the lake. Then he realized it was useless to follow
any further as he would be unable to overtake him before he reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the lake, and he knew if he followed that far Billy would swim it
and he could not do that in late November with any comfort.
So back he went to the barnyard grumbling to himself, &#8220;Well, if
I can&#8217;t catch that turkey, I will another if I have to stay up all
night to do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reached the barnyard he heard Mr. Watson and Hiram
as well as the two boys laughing so he hurried on to see what they
were finding so funny. He arrived just as it was all over, though
he did see Hiram shaking himself and picking hay out of his hair
with one hand as with the other he held out to Mr. Watson the
big turkey gobbler, dead. Yes, the one that had been up in the
tree and had run to the barn to hide. He had flown into the mow
to hide and Hiram had seen a long turkey feather fluttering on
the hay of the loft as if it had just been dropped. Climbing up
the ladder, he saw Mr. Turkey trying to hide himself in the hay.
After a long chase and many a fall for both man and turkey, as
hay is difficult to run on, Hiram succeeded in catching him. He
was going toward the ladder to descend to the barn floor and in
the dim light of the mow he did not see the hay chute. Before
he knew it, he had walked straight into the opening and had slid
to the bottom, landing on his head and shoulders, but with the
turkey still clasped to his breast. In some way the turkey&#8217;s neck
had been twisted in the fall and when they looked at him after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Hiram stood up, they found him dead. But he died in a good cause
for the next day he with two other turkeys made all the family
and several of their most intimate neighbors happy as they feasted
on his tender meat thickly covered with rich gravy.</p>

<p>Such a dinner as that was! The table fairly groaned under the
load of goodies. Two tables had been put together and they extended
through the dining room into the living-room, furnishing
seats for twenty, to say nothing of a third table spread for the children
so they would not have to wait until the grown-ups had eaten.
You see Mrs. Watson thought it cruel to make children wait when
in all probability they were hungrier than the grown-ups as children
always have healthy appetites while some adults suffer with
dyspepsia. There were several servants to wait on the table, as
Mrs. Watson had seen to that. She did not like to jump up and
down when she acted as hostess. And neither did she have the
dinner served in courses, with the exception of the soup and dessert.</p>

<p>The tables were most tastily decorated with strings of cranberries
and the dishes were garnished with all sorts of flowers cut from
vegetables. There were roses cut from beets, white roses formed
from mashed potatoes, tulips cut out of yellow carrots, and so forth.
The turkeys were festooned with cranberries and surrounded with
vegetable flowers. But the most gorgeous thing on the entire table
was a graceful basket of fruit and flowers combined. Here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
there peeked out a yellow grapefruit beside a red, red apple, while
a bunch of blue or white grapes cuddled next a banana or tangerine,
all arranged in a most artistic manner, with a bunch of huge
Malaga grapes tied to the handle with a bright scarlet ribbon bow.</p>

<p>This basket was flanked on either side by a little pig roasted whole
with a red apple in its mouth, while at both ends of the table rested
the big twenty-pound turkeys browned to a turn. Here and
there were vegetable dishes heaped high with fluffy mashed
potatoes sprinkled with paprika. There were also candied sweet
potatoes half hidden in their candy dip, while sparkling glass
dishes held molds of cranberries, preserved cherries, pickled
peaches, candied watermelon rind and many kinds of salted nuts.
All these things were on the tables at once, including a delectable
fruit salad. After the table was cleared of these viands, the dessert
was carried in, and I know all the guests wondered how they could
eat it. It consisted of mince pie, apple pie, cranberry pie and
pumpkin pie served with cheese, followed by ice-cream with chocolate
sauce poured over it, angel cake, chocolate layer cake and nut
cake, while sweet cider made right on the farm sparkled in the
glasses and the aroma of the best of coffee arose from the cups.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not be able to eat for a week after this dinner, Mrs. Watson,&#8221;
said one of her guests on leaving the table.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i-159.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will,&#8221; replied the hostess. &#8220;Mr. Watson always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
says the same thing but by seven-thirty he is ready to eat again
and he says, &#8216;Did I hear you say, mama (that is what he always
calls me) that we are not going to have any supper after our late
dinner? Well, I don&#8217;t mind much, but I feel as if I could wash
down a small piece of cold turkey and a stalk or two of celery.&#8217;
And I always tell him if he feels that way, to go to the ice-box and
help himself. Which he does and I can&#8217;t see but what he eats as
heartily as if he had not had such a heavy dinner. But then he
is so passionately fond of turkey and the things which go with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After dinner the men were smoking and the ladies were upstairs
primping and chatting when everyone was startled by the most
terrific banging of tin cans. It sounded as if a whole tin shop was
being wrecked.</p>

<p>They all ran to the windows to see what was happening and what
they saw caused gales of laughter, for there was Billy Whiskers
running around frantically trying to get the ice-cream freezer off
his head. He had been nosing around and, discovering the freezer,
had tasted the salt on the ice. In endeavoring to get more of the
salt, Billy had upset the whole thing and his horns had been caught
in the tub that held the freezer and the ice pack. The more he
tried to get the tub off his head, the more it stuck.</p>

<p>He tossed his head up and down and tried to bang the tub on
the ground and smash it, but it was too strongly made to break.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
The metal bands held it together. Then he rolled over and over,
but no use. He got up and ran as fast as he could, but being
unable to see where he was going, the first thing he knew he ran
straight into the
little duck pond half
way down the hill.
As he went in, he hit
the edge of
the tub on the
concrete rim
of the artificial
pond&mdash;and he was
free! But Billy was so disgusted that instead of coming out where
he leaped in, he swam straight across the pond, climbed out and
ran down the hill into the woods where he stayed until he recovered
from his chagrin, for no one saw him until noon the next day.
Billy could not stand it to have anything or anybody get the better
of him.</p>



<p>With the exception of this one slight mishap every person at
the dinner and every animal and fowl in the barnyard (for they
had a double portion to eat, too, as it was Thanksgiving) declared
it was the best Thanksgiving Day they had ever passed.</p>

<small>BILLY BECOMES A MOVIE ACTOR</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-161.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BILLY was close beside Mr. Watson&#8217;s chair, that gentleman
sitting under a big elm, his chair tipped back
against its trunk, a newspaper in his hands, when a
stranger drove into the yard in a high-powered, bright
red roadster. He stopped the car and coming up to Mr. Watson,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Watson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have,&#8221; Mr. Watson replied. &#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to see if I can buy that fine looking goat beside
you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I fear you cannot. We are very fond of this goat, and he has
been a great pet with us for years. He has been away from us for
three years but has just returned. Where he was and with whom
I have no way of finding out. All I know is that one day he disappeared
and three years after that returned. He is a most surprisingly
smart goat.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;If you do not know where he has been all that time, I think I
know about part of those three years.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean to tell me you think you have
seen this goat before&mdash;while he was away
from my farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly do, and what is
more, I think I can prove it.
Have you ever felt deep down
his hair, around his neck?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-162.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Why, no, I never had any
occasion to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your permission,
I believe I can find something
that will prove to
you that I have seen this
goat before and, in fact,
owned him for several
months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surprise me!
Certainly I give you
permission to feel around his neck if you wish to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>In less than a minute, the man had run his fingers through Billy&#8217;s
hair and had brought to view a small but strongly linked gold chain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
with a round flat disk of gold hanging from it, which bore some
engraving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kindly read what it says on the disk?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson took it and adjusting his glasses on his nose leaned
over Billy and read:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">
This badge was presented<br />
to<br />
<span class="smcap">Billy Whiskers</span><br />
for his bravery in saving the life of a child<br />
from a burning building<br />
in the<br />
town of Plumbville<br />
on May sixth, in the year 1921</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is most astonishing news! But I can well believe it. Billy
is so smart and so brave. He is absolutely fearless,&#8221; said Mr.
Watson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you would want quite a high price for him if you
sold him,&#8221; responded the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should, but I haven&#8217;t the least idea of selling him. We
are all too fond of him for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very much disappointed. But could I not induce you to
change your mind, if I offered you the largest sum that has ever
been given for a goat?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;No. Money cannot buy Billy Whiskers. I shall keep him
until he dies of old age, or I do,&#8221; said Mr. Watson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am more sorry than I can tell you, as I wanted particularly
to have him act in a high-class movie I am putting on the
screen. You see when I owned him, or thought I owned him, he
was my best drawing card in the movies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Watson began to laugh. It struck him as funny that Billy,
who had done nearly everything, to be sure, had also been in the
movies. &#8220;But when I think of it, I don&#8217;t know why he should <i>not</i>
be a success in the movies, for he was a first-class actor in the circus
for two or three years,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Watson, if you could only see the pleasure he gives to little
children when he is acting in the movies, I am sure you would let
me have him. The films he is in are shown at orphan asylums,
reform schools, charity fairs and so on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that so? Well, I certainly like to give pleasure to poor
little orphans. Tell you what I will do. I&#8217;ll <i>loan</i> him to you, but
I won&#8217;t sell him to anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are just the big-hearted man I thought you were, Mr.
Watson!&#8221; exclaimed the caller. &#8220;And I thank you for the loan of
him. We will take the best of care of him. In fact, he will have
a caretaker who does nothing but look after his health and comfort.
Why, when I had him before, I had his life insured and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
veterinary to look after his health and to oversee his food. He
was bathed and his hair combed and perfumed as if he was a human
being, while he had a big ten by ten foot box stall all to himself,
and rode in a limousine to and from the studio. Oh, I can
tell you he was treated like a king, and he will have the same treatment
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would like to hear, I will tell you the special stunt we
want him to do now. Picture to yourself a mountain fastness with
two high peaks, between them a deep cleft or cut thousands of
feet deep. On one side stands Billy with a young baby strapped
to his back, the mother standing beside him wringing her hands
in agony as she is about to make him leap across the chasm. She
has been kidnaped by bandits and carried into the mountains.
They did not know she had a baby under her shawl when they
kidnaped her, and when they made the discovery they were going
to kill the child, but she thought of this way of saving the baby&#8217;s
life. You see the goat belonged to her next-door neighbor in the
village at the foot of the mountain, and the mother was sure the
goat would take it home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think Billy will take that part, now do you?&#8221; asked
Mr. Watson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he will, for I have seen him do much more difficult
parts.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;Well, if that is the kind of thing he does, I certainly want to
see him act for the movies,&#8221; said Mr. Watson.</p>



<p>&#8220;You certainly shall. When the first film is put on, I will send
you a pass book with enough tickets in it to take your family and
intimate friends. Now I must be going, or I shall be unable to
reach Chicago by nightfall. And if you have no objection, I will
take Billy right along with me in the car. There isn&#8217;t much room
in this roadster, but I know he has ridden in roadsters before
and enjoys it and so I will have no difficulty keeping him in the
car. You may be interested to know we make all our films at the
Essenay Studios in Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy had been listening to all the two men had said, but when
he heard he was to be taken away from his family then and there,
he jumped to his feet and went bounding to the stable yard to tell
them. For how awful it would be for him to be carried off and
not have a chance to tell them where he was going! He was glad
he was not going to be sold, though to be loaned was almost as
bad as there was no knowing how long the man would keep him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jehoshaphat!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Watson. &#8220;One would think he
understood what we were saying, for he lay there as quiet as a
mouse until we spoke of taking him away and then he fled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect he is tired of being away from home as you say he has
just returned after nearly a three-year absence. He surely is smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
and I really believe he understands almost everything he hears. I
know we all thought so at the studio when he was with us.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-168.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid we will have a time to catch him,&#8221; said Mr. Watson.
&#8220;There he is in the barnyard in the midst of a crowd. I
believe he is telling them he is going to be taken away, for see how
downhearted Nannie looks, and the way she hangs her head shows
she is unhappy. The minute he sees us start for the barnyard he
will run away and we will be unable to capture him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan. I will drive away, go to town and have my
luncheon, and he will think I have departed for good and all.
Then while I am away, you try to shut him in the barn and have
him ready for me on my return, which will be right after luncheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry you have to go, for I was thinking of having the
pleasure of your company at my own table and having you tell us
what Billy did in the movies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry I cannot accept your kind invitation, but I have
a little business in the town before I go back to Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Mr. Swan, the movie man, had gone, Mr. Watson went in
the house to tell his wife about Billy and how he had loaned him
to Mr. Swan to act in the movies for a little while. &#8220;But how to
capture the foxy old fellow is more than I know,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have a difficult time of it, for he will be suspicious of
you for a few days now,&#8221; replied his wife.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;I have it!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Watson. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pick a bushel of carrots
that he loves so dearly, and take them into the barn, where I
shall leave them and go on about my business, never so much as
looking in his direction. And I shall be greatly surprised and disappointed
if when I am out of sight, he does not go straight to the
barn to get some. When I know he is in the barn, I will slip around
and shut the door, and then I shall have him safe enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>Everything proceeded
splendidly up to closing the
barn door. But the minute Billy
heard it slam he suspected foul play and
without a moment&#8217;s delay he rushed through
the barn to an open door on the opposite
side, and through this he went like a shot,
running to a little shed that sheltered
the mowing machine in winter.
It was dark as pitch in there, which he knew would aid him if no
one saw him enter. But alas for Billy! Mrs. Watson had been
watching her husband&#8217;s maneuvers from the sitting room window,
and quickly came out to tell her husband where Billy was hiding.
Then Mr. and Mrs. Watson and their hired man all crept up to the
shed and had Billy cornered like a rat in a trap before he was aware
of it. Mr. Watson and his hired man soon had a rope around his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
neck and were leading him out of the shed when Mr. Swan returned.
He drove right into the barnyard and Billy was forced to jump into
the car where he was securely tied. Then amidst the fluttering
of fowls and the distressed baaing of his family, handsome Billy
Whiskers was driven off to become a movie actor in Chicago.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
